14336;FI2T0010;RATOCA;;FP2-TELEMAN;;FP2;TELEMAN 34 : RADIATION TOLERANT CAMERA;01/11/1990;31/10/1992;;"Objectives  

The aim of the 'TELEMAN 34 - RATOCA' project was to develop, build and test a radiation tolerant TV camera using a solid state sensor array for robustness.  This was to involve the determination of the most appropriate structure and technology for the solid state image sensor.  Furthermore, the architecture of the camera head was also to be studied to minimise the direct nuclear irradiation of the sensor. It was hoped to achieve a target irradiation dose rate of more than 10 exponent 3 Gy/h and integrated dose of 10 exponent 6 Gy.
A radiation tolerant television (TV) camera is being developed using a solid state sensor array for robustness. 
After exploration of different available technologies it was decided to concentrate on multipinned phase (MPP) charge coupled device (CCD) technology. This has the advantages of a full TV resolution sensor (567 x 384 pixels). A ruggedized solid state image sensor was developed with an indium phosphide type photosensor and a silicon on insulator type reading device. The sensor head is connected to the control unit by a 3 m cable. Although the original ambitious radioactive dose targets were not achieved, the following progress has been made: 
an increase of 10 in integrated dose (to almost 4 KGy with some decrease in picture quality); an increase of 300 in dose rate (maximum acceptance level is estimated at 277 Gy h{-1} (however pictures with useful information are available up to 660 Gy h{-1}).
Exploitation
The increased tolerance to high radioactive doses allows use of the new camera in previously impossible environments such as in periodic inspection/repair tasks and emergency situations. Further development will be continued on such dose tolerant technology to include the space and military markets.
Work to be done  

Thomson TMS, with the support of CIEMAT for simulation and characterisation of structures, was to define the design of the radiation tolerant solid state sensor. This was to include an investigation into the most suitable semi conductor material for high radiation doses.  SOFRETEC was to design the electronics of the camera head and was to optimise the driving circuit. AEA Harwell was to perform the radiation testing of the mock up of the camera. 

Test strategy    

The mock-up of the camera was to be tested under laboratory conditions to prove the principle of operation and to assess radiation resistance.";;;;CSC;Sopelem Sofretec SA;FR;"Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas;Thomson Composants Militaires et Spatiaux;United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority";"ES;FR;UK";
18058;STEP0072;ISORAC;;FP2-STEP;;FP2;Infrared spectroscopy of ozone and related atmospheric constituents;01/04/1991;31/03/1993;;"The objective of the project is to provide spectroscopic data for the following 6 important atmospheric molecules to improve the quality of atmospheric data bases: nitrous oxide(N2O5), hydrogen nitrate, chlorine oxide nitrite(ClONO2), hydrous oxide(HO2), ozone,and hydrogen nitrite.
The experimental and theoretical investigations in the frame of ISORAC have improved the spectroscopic database for the seven molecules 

N2O5 dinitrogen pentoxide 
HNO3 nitric acid 
ClONO2 chlorine nitrate 
HO2 hydroperoxyl radical 
O3 ozone 
HONO nitrous acid 
N2O4 dinitrogen tetroxide 

This data will help to improve the analysis and understanding of the stratospheric chemistry in two respects: 

SHORT TERM ASPECT 

The ISORAC data will help to better evaluate and analyse the remote sensing data of EASOE sensors (e.g. MIPAS and LPMA balloon measurements). It will also be used to improve the analysis of other balloon data (e.g. IBEX far-infrared measurements) and some of the UARS retrievals. 

LONG TERM ASPECT 

The results will help to prepare a database as accurate as possible for remote sensors which will come to operation within the next years. An example is the MIPAS Fourier transform spectrometer, a core instrument on the ENVISAT-1 mission of the European Polar Platform POEM-1 to be launched in 1998. Furthermore, ISORAC will provide spectroscopic inputs for the definition of future sensor systems.
It is planned to improve the accuracy of existing data by at least a factor of 2. The spectroscopic data bases will be updated with this data and will be made available for the analysis of atmospheric measurements, especially the results of the Arctic Ozone Campaign 1991 and 1992. 

Different experimental techniques (especially concerning spectral regions and spectral bandwiths) will be applied which guarantee an appropriate validation of the results (eg Fourier transform spectroscopy (in all regions), diode laser spectroscopy (in the infrared), tunable far infrared spectroscopy (in the far infrared). 

The theoretical methods used to analyze the experimental results will be based on the highest level quantum molecular theory and will make use of perturbational treatments and direct numerical diagonalization (including resonance effects). 

The experimental work will be done in the infrared spectral region (5 to 1000 um), especially in the 10 um region (800 to 1200 cm{-1}), transition region (300 to 500 cm{-1})and the far infrared (below  200 cm{-1}). 

The data achieved by theoretical analysis of the experimental results will consist of line positions, line intensities, and pressure broadening coefficients for each molecule being investigated. 

The goal of this project is to obtain data with an accuracy better than 3E-4 cm{-1} for line positions, better than 5% for line intensities, and better than 5% for pressure broadening parameters. The minimum accuracy obtained will be at least a factor of two better than the accuracy of data presently available from the atmospheric data bases.";;;;CSC;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.;DE;"NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF ITALY;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;Università degli Studi di Firenze;Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen;Université Libre de Bruxelles;Università degli Studi di Pisa;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC);University of Strathclyde;UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA";"IT;FR;DE;BE;UK";
2782;BIOT0184;CARBBANK;;FP2-BRIDGE;;FP2;A complex carbohydrate structural database;01/02/1991;31/01/1994;;"The objective of the research programme is to create and maintain a complex carbohydrate structural database (CCSD) and a database management program (CarbBank). The database will contain all published carbohydrate structures larger than disaccharides to enable scientists to search for carbohydrate structures in a systematic and rapid fashion. Currently, the database contains about 8000 records which will be extended in the next years to about 20000. 
The latest version of the CarbBank program and the structural database, Complex Carbohydrate Structural Database (CCSD) with about 8000 records has been released. The computer program CASON was developed to translate the systematic name of a compound as used in the Chemical Abstracts (CA) registry file to a structural representation as used in CarbBank. The CA ONLINE service was utilized to search for specific structural elements of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) linked oligosaccharides. The search resulted in about 2 900 entries which were extracted and subsequently converted using the CASON program. These data were verified against the original literature.

A computer program, SUGABASE, was developed to add hydrogen-1 and carbon-13 NMR data to the structural information included in CarbBank. The database can be searched for carbohydrate structures by entering a list of chemical shift values. The resulting carbohydrate structures and NMR tables are displayed concurrently, whereby the matching monosaccharide residues in the carbohydrate structures and the matching chemical shift values in the NMR tables are highlighted. During the reporting period a carbon-13 NMR module has been appended to the database. The database of NMR tables of carbohydrate structures has been extended and includes 508 hydrogen-1 NMR records and 237 carbon-13 NMR records. The corresponding database management program has been improved and he user interface has been changed to be IBM SAA/CUA compliable.
In cooperation with scientific groups worldwide a survey of the existing literature is performed. In addition to collecting structural data manually, Chemical Abstracts (CA) services are used to provide carbohydrate structures and thus allowing for an easy access to the existing literature in that field. The CCSD contains information about complex carbohydrates larger than disaccharides with biological importance. The full primary structure, the reference, keywords and supplementary information are given for each record. Using the management program CarbBank the database can be edited and searched for whole and partial structures and text entries. Due to the menu driven CarbBank program a search can be performed easy and quickly. 

In addition to the survey of the literature the structural database will be linked to spectroscopic information, like hydrogen-1 and carbon-13 NMR data. This has already been accomplished using the preliminary version of the program SUGABASE. The development of tools to analyse the spectroscopic data utilising neural network methods are planned. Links and cross references to other databases, ie protein sequence databases will be established.  Currently the program is available for IBM compatible PCs running DOS. Development of a program version running under UNIX is in progress.";;;;CSC;CARLSBERG LABORATORY;DK;"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG";"NL;DE";
4742;SC1*0791;DENIS;;FP2-SCIENCE;;FP2;A deep near infrared survey of the southern sky;01/09/1992;31/08/1995;;"The aim of this project is to perform the southern part of a deep astronocal all-sky survey in the near infrared spectral range (project DENIS), the northern sky being surveyed in similar conditions by a US team. DENIS will be achieved in 3 years, using a dedicated 3 spectral bands (I 0.9 m; J 1.25 m m and K 2.2 m) camera equipped with the most sensitive array 
detectors presently available and attached to the 1 meter telescope of the European Southern observatory at La Silla, Chile. DENIS will be 4 order of magnitudes more sensitive than the previous survey in this spectral range. It will produce a huge data bank still now severely missing to complete our knowledge of the Universe.It will not only benefit to the whole astronomical 
community, but also produce invaluable tools for several major European astronomical programmes such as the Infrared Satellite Observatory (ISO) of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) project of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). This proposal is a request for a substantial financial and manpower support to DENIS which will be undertaken 
in a wide international framework.A consortium of 17 laboratories pertaining to 9 countries, 6 of which in the EC or EFTA, has been set up in order to the scientific objectives and to carry on the project. They have already achieved the preliminary technical studies needed for the definition of a 
dedicated focal IR camera, its data acquisition system and the Data Analysis Centers. Several most important scientific areas in astrophysical research will benefit of the data-base generated by this survey, e.g.: the search for low and very low-mass stars which might constitute an important part of the missing mass in the Galaxy, the late stellar evolution, the galactic 
structure, the local structure of the Universe, and the study of the local gravity field which may lead to major advances in observational cosmology. Our consortium includes a Science Team composed of expert scienctists in each of these areas to guarantee the highest level of scientific interpretations of the data. Expertise in all the areas relevant to the project has been sought for within the EC. Two data analysis centers will be dedicated 
to the final analysis of the data and to the release of the data products to the community. All participants will contribute to the observations, the building of parts of the instruments, the data analysis and scientific interpretations and will take part to the funding of the project through their own Institutes. The total cost of the project is estimated to 1.7MECUS and will need the participation of about 40 scientists and engineers and a corresponding manpower of 60 manyears. This project will contribute to the 
development of exchange of scientific ideas and technologies within Europe. it will provide an excellent framework for the formation of young scientists and engineers in the fields of astrophysics, image processing and analysis and computer sciences.

17178;AERO0019;FANSTIC I;;FP2-AERO 0C;;FP2;Future ATC, new systems and technologies impacts on cockpit;01/02/1990;31/01/1992;;"To establish the integration into civil aircraft flight decks of new systems and advanced ATC procedures and analyse usage of new technologies in cockpit design. Expected improvements in flight deck design will be due to 2 different reasons: 
The emergence of advanced Air Traffic Control related systems and functions, with new aspects of control and display for pilots. 
The use of new techniques and technologies to improve the way in which pilots control the aircraft.
The current increase in air traffic leads to the question of the augmentation of the airspace capacity. One solution consists in reducing airplane separation. The consequence is the need for:
airborne collision avoidance system;
accurate aircraft localization;
enhanced air traffic control (ATC) systems to estimate and monitor aircraft trajectories;
data link and aeronautical telecommunications network (ATN) to allow air to ground data exchange. Digital communications dedicated to ATC purposes were studied from the ergonomics point of view. As a result, the technical requirements of an open system interconnection (OSI) and ATN were identified. Also proposals were made for avionics architecture systems and for equipment to control the communications and information processing. The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) II, which indicates to pilots avoidance manoeuvres in the vertical plane was compared with TCAS III, which will provide avoidance manoeuvre indications in the horizontal and vertical planes. The methods of displaying the indications provided by the logic to the pilots was studied. Different concepts were evaluated by pilots on 3 different mock-ups. The problem of interface between TCAS and other airborne systems was studied. It was established that a TCAS flight management system (FMS) coupling was not desirable but coupling the TCAS to the flight director is possible. A basis for development of future cockpit display formats for civil aircraft was established. A matrix was established to allow consistent evaluation and comparison of the 2 technological principles under study:
projected 3-dimensional displays;
stereoscopic 3-dimensional displays.
Possible applications for voice control and synthesis were specified and evaluated. 2 mock-ups were built, one for cockpit display control, the other for autopilot control with an investigation of flexible command language. The man machine interface was investigated in terms of new designation devices suitable for controlling on board systems and replacing the currently used switches and push buttons. The needs of end users in terms of the man machine interface were studied and a technological investigation on databases and mass memories was carried out.
The present project will deal with the above reasons through the following activities: 
Analyse the currently specified applications for air-ground data link communications. Identify the Man-Machine Interface (MMI) requirements for the most promising applications and construct a computer-based 'mock-up' of the MMI for evaluation. Produce a definition for an airborne data link processor unit and write the specifications for the interface between data link and other aircraft systems. 
Analyse the current definition of T-CAS II (Collision Avoidance system), and investigate the existing documentation for T-CAS III. Set up a simulation of T-CAS III algorithms. Construct a computer-based 'mock-up' of the MMI for evaluation and write specifications for the interface between T-CAS III and the other aircraft systems. Define guidelines for systems certification in the European environment. 
Prospective studies on display technologies: hardware and software for projected and stereoscopic 3-dimensional viewing. 
Prospective studies on voice control and synthesis: evaluation and demonstration of representative techniques, identification of main research needs in voice control and synthesis and first analysis. 
Prospective studies on designation systems: investigation of an integrated control system for aircraft subsystems.

CHARACTERISATION, TRANSFORMATION, ANALYSIS AND TESTING OF FORAGE AND WOODY SPECIES;01/03/1990;28/02/1995;;"The objective of this project is the transformation of selected plants with antisense genes which interfere with the different steps of lignin synthesis in order to reduce the lignin content and to modify its monomeric composition. 
The negative effects of lignins on the digestibility of forage crops and other edible plants are well established. Taking into account the large variations in lignin content encountered in nature even for one plant, as well as the natural chemical diversity of lignins, it seems possible to design plants with a modified lignin content more adapted to specific agricultural and industrial uses. For a long time, this objective has interested plant breeders who have tried through conventional genetics to get forage crops, such as maize, with a reduced lignin content. The same goal can now be reached by plant genetic engineering and particularly by the use of the antisense ribonucleic acid (RNA) approach. In relation to forage digestibility the project has been focused on the improvement of alfalfa and tall fescue, perennial species characterized by productivity and hardiness, but exhibiting a low level of palatibility and digestibility.
The objective of this project is the transformation of selected plants with antisense genes which interfere with the different steps of lignin synthesis, to reduce the lignin content and to modify its monomeric composition. 
Lignins are the second most abundant compounds in the biosphere after cellulose and represent 20% of the total organic carbon. Their negative effects on the quality of forage crops and other edible plants is well established and it has been long known that lignins are one of the prime factors of forage indigestibility in cattle. In addition lignins are waste components in the pulp industry since they have to be removed from wood to obtain the chemical pulp necessary for papermaking. In Europe millions of tons of soluble lignin derivatives are prduced every year. They are poorly utilised substances and their extraction, which is the cause of a lot of pollution, is a highly expensive process. 

The content and chemical diversity of lignin in plants varies according to the species, the environmental conditions, and the specific cultivar. For a long time, plant breeders have tried through conventional genetics to design plants with a reduced and modified lignin content more adapted to specific agricultural and industrial uses. This project uses a plant genetic engineering approach to achieve the same objective but employing antisense RNA technology in the down regulation of three genes coding for enzymes involved in the lignification process; O. methyltransferase (OMT) which controls the methylation content of lignins, and cinnamoyl COA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) both specific enzymes of lignin monomer synthesis which control the flux of lignin production. The experiments will be conducted on model plants (tobacco, bean) and will then be extended to target plants of economic interest : forages (alfalfa and tall fescue), and woody plants (poplar and eucalypt). They will allow specific modification of lignin content without alteration of other traits, providing advantages in terms of the time and specificity, in comparison with manipulation by classical breeding methods. 

The project will be based on the following approach : 

a) Characterization of genes involved in lignification 
b) Transformation of model and target plants 
c) Molecular, chemical and cytological analysis of transformed plants d) Studies on digestibility (indigestibility) of modified forage crops and on technological properties of transformed woody plants in relation with pulp production 
e) Cultivation on a large scale of the transformants and field trials for testing their agronomical properties";;;;CSC;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);FR;"IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES PLC;Plant Genetics Systems NV;Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA);GENT UNIVERSITY;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;CENTRE TECHNIQUE DE L'INDUSTRIE DES PAPIERS, CARTONS ET CELLULOSES;Empresa Nacional de Celulosas SA;Société de Production et d'Approvisionnement du Plateau Central 'Rouergue, Auvergne,Gevaudan,Tarnais';UNIVERSITAET STUTTGART";"UK;BE;FR;ES;DE";

In regard to the Executive Software, all the services have been defined, namely the Real time Executive features, Communication management, Health Monitoring function, Downloading and Debugging kernels, Memory Management, initialisation, Interrupt and Exception handling, and the Avionics components library. 

In order to control the workstate of the whole cabinet in the aircraft and the management of reconfiguration, a new function named 'Supervisor' was analysed. 

In the IMA concept, the Executive Software must be able to manage multiple application programs written in Ada, each application having several tasks. In the IMAGES project it has been assumed that the Ada Run Time System was resident within the Executive Software and shared by all the applications. 

In order to have portable applications, a standardized Application/Executive interface was defined. This interface provides three different sections: 

1) Operational services. 

2) A standard Ada RTS interface used by the Ada compiler to provide the executable code of the applications. 

3) Ada real time extensions involved by the avionics applications. 

Point 2) was raised but solutions depend on agreement between Ada compiler suppliers more than between the aeronautical companies. 

In regard to the development process, a study of the applications integration highlights the need for a new life cycle. Thus, initial contacts with airworthiness authorities were made to initiate the new process of certification in IMA context.
In future integrated  modular avionics, complete independence between hardware and software will be provided by standardized executive software. This proposal aims to study this executive software through the following research tasks: 
Definition of the functional requirements for executive software, including software needed for testing purposes. Drawing up the executive-applications interface requirements followed by writing the ADA specification for this interface. The architecture of a typical application will be studied, taking into account this interface, in order to be make a pre-validation of the technique. 
Study of the impact of different system architectures on the executive software requirements, in order to complete the requirements, if necessary. 
Study of the impact of the use of ADA on specific features in avionic applications in the executive software. This may mean completing the functional requirements and will influence the preparation of the ADA specification. 
Study of the certification problems that may be raised by the new concept. Study of integration and validation techniques that assist the certification authority.

The project addressed the usability engineering issues for elderly and disabled persons through collection of a database consolidated information on user needs and techno-economic evaluations of relevant integrated broadband communications (IBC) capabilities.

An analysis of the attitudes of elderly and disabled people to telecommunications was conducted. A minitrial was done in which 15 mentally impaired persons participated. A further long term trial used 20 still picture telephones for mentally retarded adults and children staying at daycare centres. 2 books were produced these 2 books provided for the first time detailed demographic data:
a market sector analysis in terms of general European Community (EC) household spending by people on telecatics products;
the principal concerns of elderly people and the ways in which they occupy their time;
the characteristics of elderly and disabled people that are required by designers.

The TUDOR baseline reference databse (TBARD) was produced. This contains information relating to people with spcial needs in the areas of:
demography;
market sectors;
human factors;
organisations offering advice (216 records);
telematics hardware (237 records);
telematic software (148 records);
reference literature (1046 records).
The database allows designers to find out about the type and extent of disability relating to usage in their product area, the potential market this represents and the items currently available.

The results from the survey of attitudes of elderly and disabled people found that current interest in technology is a much better predictor of the perceived usefulness of future technology than demongraphic variables such as age, sex and so on. Little evidence was found of a positive relationship between age/disability and lack of interest in technology. Those people who are currently comfortable using technology tend to express enthusiasm for, and interest in, technologies of the future, particularly th ose which will make their lives easier and more pleasurable.

The result from the experiment with young mentally impaired adults shows that both patients and staff accepted very easily the use of the videophones. Only a few people showed any signs of tension or inhibition when using the videophone. For parents, the video phone allowed them to participate in their childrens' learning process, increasing understanding of their needs. For the professional, the videophone supports consultations with clients who live far away from the institution.

The results of the experiment using still picture videotelephony show that social contacts of the adult participants have been enlarged and their general use of telecommunication technology made easier. Communication impaired participants were able to use the telephone as a graphical communication aid and staff were able to give support information, at a distance, to some of their patients.
Technical Approach  

The project addressed the usability engineering issues for elderly and disabled persons through collection of a database, consolidated information on user-needs, and techno-economic evaluations of relevant IBC capabilities.  This provided a design check-list, indicating the potential uses of IBC for elderly and disabled people.  The likely impact of regulations on IBC was also considered.  

An analysis of the attitudes of elderly and disabled people to telecommunications was conducted.  6019 usable response sets were returned (45%).  The usage of terminals by elderly users was reviewed together with the design of 'help' systems and documentation support intended for such people.  An experiment on simultaneous extraction of text, voice and picture information by elderly people was run.  Finally a study was designed to investigate the strategies which older people use in transferring between different software packages and styles of system interaction.  

A mini-trial was done in which 15 mentally impaired persons participated.  A further long-term trial, used 20 still picture telephones for mentally retarded adults and children staying at daycare centres.  

Project members participate in COST 219; ETSI Technical Committee Human Factors, RACE Sub-Technical Group 5.2, and Group V Usability Engineering meetings.  

Key Issues  
For 60 million elderly people and approximately 40 million disabled citizens of the EC,  the provision of new facilities and services via IBC offers either: potential benefits; or: further isolation.  The key issue is appropriate usability design.  

Achievements  
. The production of two books: Age and Design by Collins and Rabbitt and Demography and Market Sectors Analysis of People with Special Needs in Thirteen European Countries by Sanhu and Wood.  These two books provided for the first time detailed demographic data, a market sector analysis in terms of general EC household and spending by people on telematics products, the principal concerns of elderly people and the ways in which they occupy their time, and the characteristics of elderly and disabled people that are required by designers.  
. The production fo the TUDOR baseline reference database (TBARD) which contain information relating to people with special needs in the areas of: demography, market sectors, human factors, organisations offering advice (216 records), telematic hardware (237 records), telematic software (148 records), and reference literature (1046 records).  The database allows designers to find out about the type and extent of disability relating to usage in their product area, the potential market this represents and the items currently available.  
. The results form the survey of attitudes of elderly and disabled people found that current interest in technology is a much better predictor of the perceived usefulness of future technology, than demographic variables such as age, sex and so on. Little evidence was found of a positive relationship between age / disability and lack of interest in technology.  Those people who are currently comfortable using technology tend to express enthusiasm for, and interest in technologies of the future, particularly those which will make their lives easier and more pleasurable.  
. An action plan for information dissemination with the proposed aim to raise awareness of the issues within RACE an to encourage RACE participants concerned with usage to consider elderly and disabled people as users and potential users of all 'ordinary' telecommunication services.  
. A check-list for RACE designers and others as a quick reference guide to the needs of the disabled.  
. The result from the experiment with young mentally impaired adults shows that both patients and staff accepted very easily the use of the videophones. Only a few people showed any signs of tension or inhibition when using the videophone.  For parents, the videophone allowed them to participate in their childrens' learning process, increasing their understanding their needs.  For the professional, the videophone supports consultations with clients who live far away from the institution.  However it can prove more difficult to intervene when the client is distracted: it is not possible to establish physical contact with the client which may be very important in certain situations.  
. The results of the experiment using still picture videotelephony show that social contacts of the adult participants have been enlarged, and their general use of telecommunication technology made easier. Communication impaired participants were able to use the telephone as a graphical communication aid and staff were able to give support information at a distance, to some of their patients.  

Expected Impact  
All project activities have raised awareness of the need to consider disabled and elderly persons within the telecommunications environment.  Other impact includes:  

. IBC services that help overcome the present communications handicap experienced by some users,  
. a decrease in the number of people that could become relatively more handicapped in an IBC society,  
. better designed systems and services for the population as a whole.  
. better informed RACE designers re the needs of the elderly and disabled users,  
. better coverage by the common functional specifications and ETSI standards of elderly and disabled users needs,  
. destruction of the myths of poverty, techno-fear and smallness of this major group of people in the EC.";;;;;ALCATEL SEL AG;DE;"University of Manchester;Swedish Telecom & Swedish Handicap Institute;FMH - Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa;PTT Netherlands  Research;University of Northumbria at Newcastle";"UK;SE;PT;NL";

The SIMPR project developed new techniques for the management of text stored in very large information banks, such as text published on optical media. A first prototype system for the semiautomatic indexing of technical texts was designed and built. Implemented as a module within an existing information retrieval software system, the indexing prototype processes ASCII texts to extract analytics, that is, terms that accurately reflect the meaning of a text. These analytics are validated by the user and then stored in indexes for subsequent search against keyworks specified in a request for information. The prototype incorporates advanced linguistic software, performing morphological and syntactic analysis and disambiguation of texts. The results from the project include:
linguistic software to analyse the morphology and syntax of texts (this software succeeds in disambiguating input texts);
information indexing techniques for use with existing or innovative information retrieval systems (these techniques represent an advance on the current technique of file inversion, offering greater accuracy of retrieval via validated indexes);
information modelling techniques, enabling the author of an information bank to impose different structures on it depending on different user requirements, and enabling the user to retrieve information by tracing a path through a selected model (these models will contain facilities for the subject classification of texts, including software to find information using a search request specifying the subject required);
techniques to map information commonalities between texts and databases for computer aided design (CAD) systems.

The final output of the project is a system for creating and managing large information banks, such as an authoring system for optical information stores.

Technical Summary  

The IBC on-line environment ultimately consists of a telecom-oriented operating system with special enhancements to meet particular IBC requirements (such as extendibility and dependability).  

The IOLE project developed and validated (through prototypes) an architecture, describing the logical structure and the interfaces offered by the on-line environment, and a set of related models.  The project was centred on the execution environment for IBC applications.  The project defined the architecture for its on-line environment, and defined the corresponding interface.  This was done in conjunction with an implementation model, methodologies and tools for on-line software extension, fault tolerance, testing, monitoring and HMI.  

The IOLE application model includes a set of rules for organising and structuring an IBC application and the information needed to describe it (for example, documentation, configuration information, on-line software extension preparatory information); this model must benefit from tight consistency with the on-line interface design.  

The IOLE communication model describes the fundamental communication mechanisms supported by the on-line interface.  This model deeply affects the strategies for on-line software extension, on-line testing, fault tolerance and also the IBC Application Model.  

Some of the research items considered by IOLE were:  

- techniques for user-transparent tolerance of hardware faults  
- guidelines for the design and implementation of computing elements to support the on-line interface  
- intra-node interconnection network communication protocol proposal  
- non-disruptive multiple-component software extension methodology  
- function and data consistency planning algorithms  
- minimally disruptive state transfer strategy  
- distributed algorithms for the detection of termination of collections of components.  

The methodology for on-line software extension defined by IOLE provides the basis for performing software extensions and the testing and monitoring of the newly introduced software without disturbing the provision of services.  

The IOLE on-line environment offers three basic tools: on-line software extension, on-line testing and human- machine interface.

1850;JOUE0027;ASOF;;FP2-JOULE 1;;FP2;Development of an advanced 1kW solid oxide fuel cell prototype;01/05/1990;31/10/1991;;"Develop 25-40 W SOFC cells which are based on a new cell design which combines the advantages of flat plate and tubular design (in a second phase which does not form part of this contract, it is the intention to construct a 1 kW unit). 
A prototype demonstration of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) generator in the 500 W class was prepared. The work included the development and characterization of novel ceramic materials, the construction of SOFC modules and of a test generator system, tests and design studies for methane reforming in the system, mathematical modelling of the SOFC stack, system studies, cost calculations and market research. 

A construction concept for SOFC modules was proposed and executed which was designed for the exclusive use of ceramic mass production technologies with the potential of low costs: extrusion, tape casting, tape calendering, screen printing and others. 

Module test data were obtained mostly with single cell modules which comprise all the functional elements of multicell modules, in special the interconnection elements. Maximum power densities of up to 1.6 kW/m{2} were obtained (maximum power per active area, 1000 C, hydrogen versus air). A value of 1.2 kW/m{2} was established for standard manufacturing conditions. Long time tests were extended to over 2000 hours and showed good stability beyond an initial power decay of 15% to 20% of the maximum. The modules withstood up to three thermal cycles (1000 C - room temperature) without significant loss of performance. 

Multicell modules up to the size of 16 cells were manufactured and tested. The assembling technique was transferred to larger units without affecting their mechanical integrity. The power densities decreased to 1.1 kW/m{2} for modules with four cells and to 0.65 kW/m{2} (11 W) for the best 16-cell module. 

The applicability of stack construction and fabrication techniques was demonstrated. A technical production, however, requires more fundamental studies on materials and processing. A novel construction concept was devised during the work and is being developed further in the framework of the JOULE II programme. 

Small scale industrial cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) with capacities below 200 kWe and steam raising capability was identified as a market opportunity for the SOFC. Domestic CHP was investigated as a second market niche. This application has the potential to enable the market entry of the SOFC with very small unit sizes in the order of one kW.
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) offer the possibility to produce electricity from coal or methane with efficiencies of 50-60% at pollution levels which are 10 times lower than for conventional power generation plants. These ceramic fuel cells operate at  around 1000 C and produce high temperature waste heat; this makes them also suitable for co-generation. At present Westinghouse (US) is most advanced in the development of SOFC and presently 25 kW units are being constructed. Their concept of SOFC is based on a tubular design which is not likely to become economically feasible. EC SOFC is therefore aiming at other concepts which allow cheap mass production, easy scaling up and which have the promise of becoming cost effective. In the EC programme two  groups lead by ABB (contract JOUE-CT90-0027), and Siemens (contract JOUE-CT90-0048) are presently developing 1 kW SOFC according to different concepts. 

This project is led by ABB which under the name of BBC between 1968 and 1976 had an extensive programme on SOFC; during this period extensive know-how has been developed. That programme was abandoned in 1976 because the tubular design, developed at that time, was not believed to become cost effective. ABB has now  started again with a completely different design, which combines the advantages of flat plate and tubular SOFC. In this contract (JOUE-CT90-0027) the new SOFC concept will be optimized by investigating different materials for electrodes and electrolytes and different fabrication methods. 

ICI is preparing raw ceramic materials and develops a porous ceramic support structure on which electrodes and electrolytes will be deposited. Different ways of electrolyte preparation are being investigated by ICI (tape rolling), RIS  (tape casting) and ABB (screen printing and plasma spraying). RIS  and TNO are exploring a number of new materials for electrodes while electrode fabrication methods are studied by ABB. ABB, SINTEF, TNO and BRITISH GAS will develop and validate engineering models.

TELEMAN 48 INGRID is a robust mobile machine consisting of an integrated gantry and manipulator robot system which will demonstrate computer aided teleoperation.  The control system will be fully integrated so that a wide range of hardware can be deployed on the gantry robot facility and simultaneously controlled from a single work station. The system is to be capable of performing a broad range of representative remote handling tasks which are directly applicable to the operation of a nuclear plant and also transferable to many other hazardous robotic operations.
A robust mobile machine (INGRID) consisting of an integrated gantry and manipulator robot system is being developed which will demonstrate computer aided teleoperation. 
INGRID is currently undergoing final integration and commissioning before the execution of test scenarios. Work prior to this stage has been successful in developing further and adapting the results of the previous projects; these achievements enable integration and subsequent evaluation. 

The spatial, functional and procedural components of the remote handling workstation (RHWS), have been successfully integrated providing a man machine interface to the devices and the working environment together with operational aids. The integrating and coordinating semiautonomous controller (SAC) has been implemented, enabling control of the various subsystems from the RHWS. Improvement to the path planning support system by utilizing a guide method has produced a system capable of providing planned routes in an accelerated time scale. A revised gantry control system is operational allowing both teleoperated and programmed control; whilst the Harwell telerobotic controller (HTC) has been upgraded providing BSP based bilateral teleoperation and force controlled robotic execution of various tasks. The Universal teleoperator device configured on a Puma 260 is capable of dextrous operation in a number of modes including bilateral and rate control whilst results using active compliance force control algorithms for manual teleoperation have shown a significant improvement during hard contact tasks. The lateral collision sensor system and modular sensor have been developed and successfully demonstrated. A 3-dimensional zoom lens radiation tolerant camera and associated pan and tilt head have been developed together with a measuring system to extract position data from a camera view. Furthermore a qualitative reliability analysis which includes an assessment of radiation induced failures has been completed.
Exploitation
Results of research on building blocks in earlier TELEMAN projects TM1 - ARTIST, TM7 - VISYS, TM20 - MAGIC, TM26 - SIMPLE, and TM41 - ENTOREL are being further developed and integrated in the TELEMAN TM48 - INGIRD robust gantry-mounted telemanipulator research machine project. Main components of the current project are being used fully by partners within their own in-house research and plant support projects. The results to date of each individual partner's achievements are being widely marketed and are, in specific cases, commercially viable. Further opportunities for exploitation are available following full integration and testing of the TELEMAN TM48 - INGRID facility.
Work to be done  

The work programme has been sectioned into four task areas which will be developed for integration in the last phase of the project.  

(a) Remote handling work station  
The provision of an integrated work station capable of planning and simulation, and subsequent monitoring and controlling of all devices within the system during mission execution, enabling ergonomic and transparent remote operation whilst in manual mode and maintaining overall supervisory control during semi-autonomous operation.  

(b) Control system  
A fully integrated control system, including the semi-autonomous controller, device sub-system controllers and the sensor support system, capable of real-time communications between external sensors and sub-system controllers, with fault tolerant hardware and software control sub-system modules.  

(c) Generic devices  
A range of generic devices will constitute the functional basis of the system. These will include the viewing cameras, the manipulator robot and end effectors, the gantry and hoist,  and the force/torque sensors.  

(d) Design, implementation and testing of scenarios  
Scenarios of representative missions which such a system might be required to perform are to be defined in order to set the working parameters and specifications of the complete system.  Global motion planning for the redundant gantry and manipulator robot system will be performed in collaboration with the PIAP Institute, Warsaw, Poland. In addition, final year student research projects will be carried out at the Universities of Hannover, Newcastle upon Tyne, and the Technical University of Denmark.

The general objective is the evaluation of the sensitivity of the radiological consequences associated with deep nuclear waste disposal with regard to the different elements in the performance assessment, for the following geological formations: clay, granite and salt and for high level radioactive waste (HLW) and medium level radioactive waste (MLW).

On the basis of an exchange of informations and viewpoints, a first list of features, events and processes to be taken into account for clay, granite and salt, has been established. On the basis of this list, a list of important scenarios to be considered in the EVEREST project for each specific formation has been defined. 2 different approaches have been used for the identification of the scenarios within the national programmes of performance assessment. A first approach considers that the disposal system is separated into barriers. The second approach considers the 3 different systems, near field, geosphere and biosphere as a whole system without prejudging the role that can play each barrier. Although the selection procedure are different, several elements common between the 2 approaches have led to a common list of relevant scenarios for each formation.
A draft document on radionuclide inventories for several kind of fuel, standard, high burn up fuel and MOX has been presented.
Work programme:

Methodology: 

This phase will be divided into four steps: identification of main features controlling the radionuclide transfer to human beings, scenarios, definition of calculations to be performed and reflexion on different approaches and techniques of sensitivity analyses. 

Model description and data collection: 

Documentation and presentation of the models and codes to be used, compilation of the site data and of the other data (waste inventory, package, repository design...) 

Calculations: 

Deterministic and stochastic calculations for normal and altered selected scenarios for each site. The results obtained will be used for sensitivity analyses.

Each site will provide common data on atmospheric inputs and drainage water outputs, (the network comprises 17 groups of experimental catchments in 7 countries), plus basic site and environmental data. Data collection, sampling and chemical analysis of samples will be carried out using common protocols. A central database will be established at the University of Goettingen and each site will provide data to this data base in common formats. 

The following process studies will be carried out in subsets of the catchments. 
Weathering rates and processes: quantification of base cation production from mineral weathering in a range of rock and soil types. 
Quantification of atmospheric inputs: quantification of total atmospheric inputs to catchments; comparison of available methods; and production of protocols for future studies. 
Water pathways and residence times: quantification of the contribution of water from different sources to streams at varying flows, in a range of catchment types represented by the network. 
Ion exchange and A1 mobilization: development of improved models of ion exchange and A1 mobilization and immobilization for incorporation in hydrochemical models. 
Sulphate fluxes: improved models of the processes controlling sulphate retention and production in soil plant systems. 
Nitrate fluxes: improved models of the processes controlling nitrate retention and production in soil plant systems. 

Experimental manipulations at selected catchments to allow testing, and further development of the models will be carried out: additions of nitric acid (a Gardsjon subcatchment); removal of excess nitrate and sulphate from atmospheric inputs (a Gardsjon subcatchment); liming (a Llyn Brianne subcatchment); clearcuttings (a Waroneu subcatchment); clearance of understorey vegetation (a Filebres subcatchment); burning (a Mont Lozere subcatchment); and addition of ammonium sulphate (a Schluchsee subcatchment). 

Existing hydrochemical models (MAGIC, BIRKENES, RAINS) will be applied at catchments from each site to test the models over a wide range of environmental conditions, to identify key controlling processes and weaknesses in the models. Existing hydrochemical models using data from the process studies and experimental manipulations combined with results from application of the existing models across the network will be modified and enhanced. 

Empirical models linking hydrochemistry to aquatic biota, initially using data from catchments in the United Kingdom will be developed and using data from other catchments in the network. 

Forest growth models and hydrochemical models will be linked and tested using data from clearcutting studies and the sites in the network showing signs of frost damage.

Work has been concentrated on the motorway environment taking into account the whole traffic phenomenon in order to assess benefits or disadvantages for the community rather than for the single user. Also the point of view of the motorway operator is considered, by looking at the management of information pertinent to cooperative driving concepts, for a better exploitation of motorway infrastructure.

Studies have been conducted:
to provide traffic scenarios at different levels of detail;
to provide simulation tools suitable for evaluation and final assessment;
to define in detail, formalise and simulate strategies on cooperative driving;
to assess by simulation the system architecture;
to design field trials and have them carried out;
to provide results about legal and social aspects mainly in the area of user acceptance;
to assess intelligent cruise control (ICC) strategies for different levels of automation identified by means of microsimulation;
to define and assess intelligent manoeuvring control (IMC) strategies (microsimulation);
to define new speed flow relationships;
to have a microsimulator calibrated incorporating ICC and IMC effects;
to have a macrosimulator calibrated incorporating ICC and IMC effects;
to evaluate the impact on European traffic of the envisaged strategies;
to define final requirements and specifications for a system architecture;
to provide recommendations for further implementation and research work.
The overall work will be carried out through three different and related work areas proceeding in parallel: 'scenario', 'system specification', and 'evaluation'. The 'scenario' approach insures that all the relevant aspects of the problem are taken into account in a comprehensive and integrated way. The 'system specification' area will provide for the innovation in system elements to be proposed and analysed and finally, the 'evaluation' area will provide for an overall unbiased evaluation. This evaluation will produce both quantitative results (for safety and efficiency aspects) and qualitative remarks on the feasibility of the system (for legal, social and user acceptance aspects). 
Micro and macro simulation exercises as well as field trials will be used for the validation of the proposed strategies and it is also assumed that Project dealing with vehicle to vehicle and road side to vehicle communications will provide useful exchange in this area.

The importance of human and organisational factors in the information technology (IT) uptake process is generally recognised, but real understanding of these issues is confined to behavioural scientists, who are generally isolated from the main body of IT practitioners.

The project aimed to demonstrate that complex domains of behavioural science expertise can be presented in an interesting way, and was designed to facilitate the transfer of this knowledge to a wide range of information technology (IT) professionals and user organizations via a technology based uptake support environment, or IT-USE.

The main result from IT-USE was an intelligent support environment prototype containing a structured knowledge base elicited from behavioural scientists and IT professionals, presented to the user in a manner which exploits the technical capability of interactive video technology and experts systems technology. The novel application of these technologies to aid the dissemination of information concerning complex, but highly relevant, domains of behavioural sicence is a product in its own right, as well as providing significant potential benefits to users of IT-USE. The prototype consists of an interactive graphical interface, a system of interactive video sequences, a structured knowledge base, a toolbox containing material accessible to the suer derived from the latter, and an information management system. Thes components can be separated into courseware and supportware. The resulting product will enable the user to recognize in advance, and thus avoid, human and organizational problems which currently give rise to IT uptake failures, and to implement effectively IT system uptake strategies which enhance the quality of working life.
A substantial knowledge-base exists which addresses: 

- human and organisational factors in IT uptake processes in user organisations 
- transformations in the design of work and organisations through IT uptake and possible implications for the quality of working life, including training for IT uptake 
- user aspects of hardware and software, particularly the usability and acceptability of IT products and applications 
- methodologies for the design and implementation of IT application systems in user organisations 
- the strategic/competitive importance of IT uptake as a component of business planning, and especially of organisational innovation for competitiveness. 

This project integrated a number of leading-edge aspects of IT (interactive video, a comprehensive knowledge-base made up of text, graphics, animated graphics and video, and an expert systems interface to the user) as a means of storing, structuring and presenting this complex behavioural science knowledge to users of IT-USE.";;;;;IRISH MEDICAL SYSTEMS;IE;"SCAITECH A/S;HANDELSHOJSKOLEN I KOBENHAVN (COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL);DATACENTRALEN AF 1959;FutureMedia Ltd;MEMORY COMPUTER;RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN;WORK RESEARCH CENTRE";"DK;UK;IE;NL";

-the design of a general computational model of a dictionary entry 
-the degree to which machine-readable dictionaries contain lexical, syntactic and semantic information which can be made explicit and can be reused in natural language processing systems 
-the development of methods and techniques for the extraction of syntactic and semantic information from machine-readable dictionaries 
-the semi-automatic construction of taxonomies starting from machine-readable dictionaries 
-the design and organisation of a single lexical knowledge-base with concepts and relations for the different languages involved.
Techniques and methodologies for using existing machine readable dictionaries in the construction of components for natural language processing systems were developed. The main focus was on the extraction of lexical information from multiple machine readable sources in a multilingual context, with the overall goal of constructing a single multilingual lexical knowledge base.

The results achieved so far involve:
a second release of the lexical database software;
conversion of the machine readable dictionary sources onto the lexical database (LDB);
supply of semantic taxonomies;
an English analyser system;
first releases of the lexical knowledge base software;
definition of common set of types and features structures.

Research is currently being undertaken on:
continuing the construction of taxonomies for the different monolingual dictionaries;
merging of taxonomies derived from different dictionaries;
implementing the lexical knowledge base system;
definition of a system of typed feature structures for the formalization of syntactic and semantic information;
development of a prototype of the natural language processing test bed system.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach was based on theoretical linguistics, computational lexicography and lexicology, and computational linguistics. The main themes were: 
-A formal analysis of the structure and content of existing machine-readable dictionaries, in order to design an explicit and standardised representation language for the computational model of the dictionary entry. 
-The design of procedures for the extraction of super-ordinates from natural language definitions, for their disambiguation, and for the construction of taxonomies throughout the lexicon. 
-The design of procedures for the linguistic and computational analysis of natural language definitions, with the aim of extracting all the semantic information implicit in them. 
-The study of ways of representing the semantic and syntactic information which is extracted in a unification-based lexical representation language using typed feature structures and supporting default inheritance. 
-The design and implementation of basic software for the creation, accessing and processing of lexical databases and lexical knowledge-bases. 
-The study of how to link taxonomies and conceptual or relational information coming from different sources (either monolingual or multilingual). 
-The design of a natural language processing test-bed for the information extracted from machine-readable dictionaries.

8704;5660;PECOS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Perspectives on Cooperative Systems;01/10/1990;30/09/1991;;"This exploratory action aims to investigate models for Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Increased importance is being attached to the cooperative approach to work by groups of organisations, whereby common objectives may be established and pursued.
New methodological proposals were made based on 2 practical contexts. The first was the management of a complex industrial project, the construction of a high speed train for the Italian railway, which required cooperation among 4 private companies. The second was the design of an information system for water management in the Lombardy region, which required cooperation among several different branches of public administration. These contexts were studied, applying techniques of enterprise modelling, in order to identify requirements for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. It was concluded that CSCW technology could facilitate a heterarchical style of management, particularly appropriate for complex industrial projects with an innovative product and time based competition. The action suggests a methodology which emphasizes the importance of modelling the application context and integrating all tools into a common environment.

Problems are defined through the following steps: elicit and collect statements of need and policy; express these statements in an appropriate problem owners, and revise them until consensus is reached; identify, specify, and justify the implied functional requirements. Although here presented sequentially, these steps will in practice be performed iteratively. The elements of a solution architecture are as follows: definition of the application domain, and the sort of needs and policies which it is designed to address; specification of the components from which a solution may be configured; rules for combining these components; recommendations, guidelines, and examples of good engineering practice. To create interesting solutions requires powerful components flexibly combined. If the rules of combination permit only safe, well behaved solutions, experience shows that they will also be of little value or interest.

The proposed method defines roles and responsibilities for people as well as providing tools and procedures. T hus, on the psychological/social side of the solution domain components such as decision conferences, consensus mechanisms and coordination roles are defined. These are implemented at the organizational level. On the technology side solution components such as intelligent problem solving models, distributed document conference shells and common user interface managers are required.
A central concept of CSCW models is that of the intelligent agent, which can be an ordinary user or a software module implementing functionalities of various degrees of intelligence. Well-understood schemes of cooperation are essential in order for such agents to collaborate successfully in achieving goals. To meet this objective a study of possible inter-agent structures will be conducted. 

The PECOS action will include an evaluation of the state of the art as regards both technological capability and organisational theory and practice. It will also assess the scope and scale of the market needs which cooperative working will generate in the short and medium term. 

A conceptual analysis is essential in order to evaluate these CSCW tools; the pre-requisite for such an analysis is a clear model of organisational cooperation, both in general and in relation to specific organisational tasks. The development of such an analytical model is therefore the key aspect of the action. In order to better identify such a model within the period allotted, two small case studies will be carried out, with the collaboration of two partners acting as users, in two different areas of cooperative work: co-work management and decision-making for complex projects. The model will play a crucial role in the identification of an appropriate software architecture to represent the cooperation platform of the envisaged environment, whose definition is part of the aims of the action. 

The expected results of the PECOS action will be delivered as a final report together with two small animation prototypes of the systems designed for the case studies. These will serve mainly as explanatory support to the cooperation modelling approach and software architecture described in the final report.";;;;;Artificial Intelligence Software SpA;IT;"UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;THE BABBAGE INSTITUTE FOR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;Emmepi;INDUSTRIAS DE TELECOMUNICATIONES;Lombardia Informatica SpA;MARI Applied Technologies Ltd";"ES;BE;IT;UK";

-What declarative theory of grammar (extending from phonetics to discourse) would best support incremental interpretation and top-down information flow? 
-How can existing unification-based grammar formalisms be developed so as to increase their ability to express high-level generalisations, while retaining a clear semantics and computational interpretation? 
-How is the informational content of an utterance integrated into the current discourse context? 
-What formal models can adequately capture the defeasibility and non-monotonic character of human reasoning? 
-To what extent is it possible to synthesise the formal methods used for modelling partial information in speech, grammar, semantics and reasoning?
Fundamental questions about the integration of logic, natural language and speech were addressed, focussing on the themes of partial information and dynamic interpretation in natural language processing, with particular attention to developing a computational and cognitively motivated model of how spoken language is understood.

The available deliverables cover the following areas:
grammar development (speech and prosody involving parametric variation in German and Romance, flexible montague grammar, psycholinguistic studies in the incremental interpretation of speech and the labelling of intonation contours);
meaning, discourse and reasoning (generalized quantifier logic for naked infinitives, dynamic predicate logic, dynamic montague grammar, the semantics of progressives and perfects, conditionals, and defaults and belief revision);
logic and computation (a comprehensive unification formalizm for linguistic applications constraint logic programming for natural language analysis and foundations of unification based formalizms);
a prototype intonational parser and a (nearly) deterministic parser.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The work was divided into three interdependent themes: 
-Grammar development, speech and prosody, emphasising the development of formal models, the abstract specification and parametric variation of linguistic structure, the incorporation of intonational structure into the representation of utterances, and th e investigation of the interplay of intelligibility, predictability and discourse context in speech recognition and production. 
-Meaning, discourse and reasoning, addressing the further development of the dynamic and partial models of meaning that have been emerging in the past decade. In addition, non-monotonic logic will be used, taking into account conditional reasoning and in feasibility in lexical concept combination. The Action aimed to formalise default interpretation, which plays a role in various aspects of linguistic structures. 
-Logic and computation, directed towards the development of formal mathematical and computationally tractable models of natural language, encompassing recent extensions of unification formalisms. 
In the final phase of this Action, work on classes of algebraic description spaces and a comprehensive unification formalism for linguistic applications was to be incorporated and implemented, as well as a proof theory for temporal formalisms. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The available deliverables cover the following areas: 
-Grammar development. speech and prosody: parametric variation in German and Romance; Flexible Montague Grammar; psycholinguistic studies in the incremental interpretation of speech; the labelling of intonation contours. 
-Meaning, discourse and reasoning: generalised quantifier logic for naked infinitives; dynamic predicate logic; Dynamic Montague Grammar; the semantics of progressives and perfects, conditionals, defaults and belief revision. 
-Logic and computation: a comprehensive unification formalism for linguistic applications; constraint logic programming for natural language analysis; foundations of unification-based formalisms. 
Other deliverables include a prototype intonational parser, and a (nearly) deterministic parser.

POTENTIAL 
The research themes that constitute the DYANA Action aim to meet some of the challenges that lie ahead on our way to computer systems that use spoken or written human language.

Application experiments have been carried out using existing constraint logic programming (CLP) platforms. New requirements have been identified for the development of the future platform: temporal reasoning, design and verification of finite state systems, new computation domains such as symbolic and nonlinear constraints, and new computation rules. 

A list of good practices for programming with CLP has been set up and will lead to a full methodology. Tools for the programming environment and the development of the new platform are in progress.
Recent advances in CLP, in particular the CHIP system developed at the European Computer Industry Research Centre (ECRC), have given Europe a significant lead in technology suited to large combinatorial problems, such as those confronted in production management, VLSI design, financial systems, logistics and network management. The three industrial partners (Bull, ICL LTD and Siemens) have absorbed the CHIP system into their own product lines and are currently seeking to enhance and extend their applications. 

The basic strategy of the work programme is to take the CHIP system as the kernel language and divide the enhancements into short, medium and long-term goals. This is intended to maximise the range of successful products while minimising the risks. Applications which are certain to emerge in the short term will be pursued in the fields described above. 

The long-term aspirations will be targeted towards engineering a successor to CHIP. Here the risk factor is not negligible. This will be partially offset by the medium-term objective, which is to extend the existing CHIP system to new problem areas such as planning, the design of communication protocols, and configuration problems. The aim is to seek a substantial increase in value added to CHIP while containing the risks. 

To tap a representative cross-section of potential users of CLP technology, a user interest group will be formed under the provisions of the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG). The six founder-members of the user group will be represented in the Consortium as associate partners and will help focus the direction of the work-programme towards the marketplace.";;;;;Siemens AG;DE;"A T Kearney;International Computers Ltd (ICL);CMSU-COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UNIT;UNIVERSITAT DE VALENCIA-LISITT;EUROPEAN COMPUTER IRC;Braghenti;IBERIA  AIRLINES;Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales - ONERA;IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;Régie Nationale des Usines Renault;Dassault Électronique;Artificial Intelligence Software SpA;Bull SA";"UK;EL;ES;DE;IT;FR";

the definition and development of methods and high level design and analysis tools to support large object oriented business application developments;
the development of software facilities to ensure successful interworking of object oriented business applications with existing commercial software tools and environments;
the development and execution of significant pilot applications for the validation of the tools and techniques produced, and their completion with 'ready to use', reusable software components for business applications.

A life cycle model has been defined based upon a distinction between the analysis and the design phase.

The objective of this project is to develop a high resolution medium which offers an increase in volume storage density up to a factor of 4 and a reduced error rate with respect to the present state of the art. Manufacturing steps and components will continue to be improved to achieve: tape substrates with lower thickness and improved quality with regard to dimensional stability, adhesion properties, surface smoothness and abrasivity (reduction of head wear); and magnetic coatings with lower particle sizes and higher homogeneity as well as an outstanding level of internal cleanliness.
The introduction of completely new processing technologies (like surface treatments) and the use of modern physical analytical methods (like surface spectroscopy) are necessary steps for successful work and are extensively used. Then the resulting tape should make it possible to record high definition television (HDTV) video information with a transmission rate of about 100 Mbit s{-1} and to increase volume storage density by about 2 orders of magnitude compared with present media, based on conventional oxide pigments.
The consortium has succeeded in developing a metal particle (MP) tape which ranks among the very best products in the field. This will be commercialized in 1992 for V8 and in 1993 for Hi8 applications. This success is largely due to the extremely homogeneous tape coating achieved as a result of a newly optimized process for dispersing the magnetic particles. Other key factors were the application of a special calendering process and the development of an ultraclean low roughness base film in order to achieve an unusually smooth surface and a very low number of dropouts.
Manufacturing steps and components have been improved to achieve: 

- tape substrates with lower thickness and improved quality with regard to dimensional stability, adhesion properties, surface smoothness and abrasivity (reduction of head-wear) 
- magnetic coatings with lower particle sizes and higher homogeneity as well as an outstanding level of internal cleanliness. 

Magnetic tapes, especially for helical scan recording, are the information media offering the highest volume storage density, even when compared with optical discs. According to the present state of the art (ie, streamers), the maximum volume storage density of these media is around 2E7 fc/mm{3}. This density is, for the time being, suitable for digital home audio and for the corresponding data storage system (R-DAT). 

Nevertheless, the emergence of new demands from the computer industry (for back-up) and from the consumer market (HDTV recorders, for instance) requires tremendous increase in the volume storage density of tape media. The use of tape-recorders, coupled with buffer memories to reduce the inconvenience of long access time, remains the best way to achieve very high rates of transfer of huge amounts of data. This new market requirement may be fulfilled by optical technologies, but magnetic tape represents the quickest answer to market demands, provided that some drawbacks of the present technology can be overcome. 

The introduction of completely new processing technologies (such as surface treatments) and the use of modern physical analytical methods (such as surface spectroscopy) are necessary steps for successful work and are extensively used. Then the resulting tape should make it possible to:

The project, known a Euro-Farmers Information Technology (EFIT), was concerned with the actual use of computers and telecommunications in farm production and management. A common observation methodology was developed and interviews were carried out in 3 participating countries, with farmers experienced in the use of information technology, concerning the range of such activities they adopted and their assessment of the relevance of each. A common database was built with the results of these interviews. Preliminary analysis suggests that applications of information technology are already achieving a significant role in the management of the farms surveyed. More than 30 separate activities were identified, ranging from external information about prices and technical advice to cash flow and budgets and to records and alert lists for animal and plant production systems. A prototype multimedia system on informatics for farmers has been developed and tested.
A common observation methodology was developed and validated in the three participating countries. Interviews with farmers, experienced in the use of IT, concerned the range of IT activities they adopted and their assessment of the relevance were completed in the first year of the project.

Such needs may be on behalf of the whole user organisation, such as requirements for dependability, flexibility, and compatibility. They may also arise from the needs of end-users for systems which are usable and acceptable, that is, which do not threaten privacy, job satisfaction, health, etc. Studies of the IT uptake process often demonstrate that it is these very factors which can prevent implementation or encourage disuse. 

The ORDIT project aims to produce a computer-based methodology that will enable design teams to make explicit non-functional requirements for their product or system. The methodology will use concepts at the organisational and work-role levels of description to represent such requirements, and will contain a database of standards, models and knowledge about the characteristics and needs of different classes of computer user. The methodology will also facilitate the testing of proposed technical solutions for matching with organisational requirements, and for their implications within the organisational environment.
As part of its work on enterprise modelling ORDIT has developed a range of educational and training materials to publicise its work and to educate organisations in the potential of enterprise modelling and the benefits it could bring to them. The internationalisation of ORDIT takes the form of a pilot seminar held in a major European capital, which involves the preparation of foreign language materials and presentations, sales and marketing in the target countries, and the provision of facilities with which to stage the seminar.
The construction of this methodology will be by a user-centred, iterative development process. The participants will be organisational theorists and human factors specialists working with system software specialists. Early prototypes of the core of the methodology will be produced and subjected to user testing. The methodology will thereafter undergo several rounds of modification, extension and progressively more rigourous and realistic user testing. This process is to ensure the resultant methodology not only meets the functional needs of design teams, but also meets their non-functional requirements for acceptable and usable tools.";;;;;Loughborough University of Technology;UK;"UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;Algotech;WORK RESEARCH CENTRE;MARI Applied Technologies Ltd";"UK;IT;IE";

Level A (time, network and country independent);
Level B (time and network dependent, country independent);
Level C (time, network and country dependent).
Key issues in the research were:
reference configurations (RC);
national evolution scenarios;
TMN standards;
regulatory issues.

The following Level B reference case studies have been completed:
synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH);
metropolitan area networks (MAN);
introduction of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM);
exploration of service management techniques.

Level C TMN reference configurations which have been completed from the series of Level B case studies are:
short term scenario in Ireland;
intermediate scenario (MAN) in Ireland;
intermediate scenario (SDH) in Sweden.

TMN reference configurations are being defined at three levels: Level A (time, network and country independent), Level B (time and network dependent, country independent) and Level C (time, network and country dependent).  The level A TMN reference configuration was defined at an early stage in the project and has recently been reviewed and revised. The Level B TMN reference configurations are being produced as a series of case studies.  

The Level C TMN reference configurations definition started with a survey of current network management implementation in a total of 67 networks operated by 14 PTOs plus 19 privately operated networks.  

Key Issues  
. Reference configurations.  
. National evolution scenarios.  
. TMN standards.  
. Regulatory issues.  

Achievements  
The Level A TMN-RC has been structured as a template comprising 6 key constituents (RCKCs) each with 4 sub- constituent members (RCSCs).  

The following Level B reference case studies have been completed:  

. synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)  
. metropolitan area networks (MAN)  
. Introduction of ATM based on the results of projects R1014 and R1022  
. exploration of service management techniques.  

Level C TMN reference configurations which have been completed from the series of Level B case studies are:  

. short term scenario in Ireland  
. intermediate scenario (MAN) in Ireland  
. intermediate scenario (SDH) in Sweden.  

Methodologies have been elaborated for TMN reference configuration design and definition of evolution scenarios.  A tool (TMN STAX) has been developed to support this methodology.  

The TMN reference configuration framework has been captured and documented in CFS M201: TMN Reference Configuration Abstract Framework; and the design activity in CFS M200: TMN Evolution.  CFS M210 covers project results on methods for TMN reference configuration design and evolution.  Related security aspects have been captured and documented in CFS H210: TMN Security Architecture.  

By the end of 1992, the project will have produced 15 deliverables.  five contributions to standard bodies, ten papers to workshops and/or conferences; and Issue C of four RACE CFSs.  In addition, the project has organised two workshops on key aspects of the TMN evolution (Open Network Provision Impact and TMN Security).  

Expected Impact  
The partners represented within the project guarantees a comprehensive coverage across Europe.  The applicability of the results to the industry and the PTOs is considered obvious.  

The project is providing guidelines on the evolution of the management systems from today's situation to the target IBC TMN.  TERRACE is therefore expected to continue its impact on the process of standardisation in the field of TMN reference configurations.  In addition, it provides a reference technical framework on which a consensus for the management of the target IBC as well as of the key stages of evolution can be achieved.";;;;;CSELT SpA;IT;"Siemens AG;BRITISH TELECOM PLC (BT);TELEFONICA DE ESPANA S.A;CET;KTAS;Dowty Communications Ltd;IBM France SA;Televerket (Swedish Telecommunications Administration);INTRACOM SA;GPT Ltd;Alcatel/ISR;NT;TLP;Societá Italiana per l'Esercizio delle Telecomunicazioni SpA;REFER;Broadcom;Ascom;ALCATEL SEL AG;France Télécom;Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBP)";"DE;UK;ES;PT;DK;FR;SE;EL;NO;IT;BE;IE;CH";
2696;STEP0038;EXMAN;;FP2-STEP;;FP2;Experimental manipulation of forest ecosystems in Europe;01/12/1990;31/12/1991;;"The objective is to investigate the effects of acid deposition on soils and ecosystems by means of experimental manipulations. 

Experimental manipulations of the biogeochemical cycles and water balance in forest ecosystems are conducted at 5 sites in Europe. Although the manipulation experiments have started in different years and on different backgrounds, the joint project has developed a high degree of intercomparability. The basic idea and project design is to perform the same or comparable manipulations of the forest ecosystem under different soil conditions, atmospheric loads and climate. The sites are: Klosterhede (Denmark) and Hoeglwald (Germany), both with medium atmospheric input of sulphur and nitrogen; and Solling (Germany), Harderwijk and Kootwijk (The Netherlands), all 3 with high atmospheric input of sulphur and nitrogen. As a reference station, without experimental manipulations, Ballyhooly (Ireland) with low atmospheric input of sulphur and nitrogen. 

The manipulations comprise fertigation to arrive at optimal soil chemical conditions (both macro and micro nutrients) and water supply for tree growth. Those manipulations are different from general fertilizer trials, since application is performed in small doses by a sprinkler system according to the demands of the trees. A similar sprinkler system is used for irrigation and experimental acidification with strong acids. Liming and traditional fertilization experiments are run in parallel at some of the sites. A major part of the manipulations are devoted to the removal of atmospheric inputs of elements, strong acids and water by the construction of roofs beneath the canopy. These roof experiments are designed to measure the response, at the ecosystem level and under controlled conditions, of a possible reduction of atmospheric inputs of air pollutants (reversibility of acidification) and water (drought). Apart from the control plot(s), at least 2 types of manipulation are performed at each site. To reduce  verlap no attempt has been made to include all types of manipulation on each site. 

At each location, the same parameters are measured, and full data exchange exists among the partners. That means that every group can apply its particular models to the data from all sites or, vice versa, that models developed by different partners can be applied to the same data set. As far as possible the same methodology and analytical techniques are used. However, since some methods have to be retrospecitvely referable to other studies on a given site, they have occasionally been retained. In a few instances this has lead to double instrumentation to obtain comparable data.";;;;CSC;Danmarks Tekniske Universitet;DK;"Department of Environmental Resource Management;Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen;GEORG-AUGUST-UNIVERSITY GOETTINGEN;Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München";"IE;NL;DE";

The goal of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a vision system development environment (VSDE) which will act as an intelligent assistant to a nonvision expert when prototyping vision systems for industrial applications.

The main features that the VSDE will provide are:
a query system for eliciting relevant application information;
automatic recommendation of image interpretation systems;
facilities for the developer experiment with algorithm chaining in an interactive environment;
a library of algorithm performance;
an environment for running the system developed;
a language in which image interpretation systems can be expressed prior to algorithm instantiation.

A first version of the interactive computing enivronment (ICE) has been completed and as part of the validation of the ICE, an exisiting nondestructive testing (NDT) has been redesigned with the ICE. A Questionnaire has been circulated to elicit development methods followed in past applications; the results are being complied for introduction in the VSDE. A definition of the Vision language has been issued and a first version of the algorithms performance library (APL) has been developed. The APL is being enhanced with a wider range of algorithms. A survey of matching algorithms has been performed and 4 mathcing techniques selected for the applications at hand. Also, a prototype task definition tool (TDT) has been developed for the specification of 3 dimensional measurement tasks based on computer aided design on (CAD) data. A mock-up of the VSDE has been demonstrated, showing the functionality of the system in the context of 2 applications, namely 3 dimensional measurement verfication and X-ray inspection of alloy wheels and a 3 dimensional inspection cell has been developed for the verification of measurements on machined workpieces.
The main features of such a VSDE include: 

- A query system for eliciting relevant application information and then guiding the user through a reduction of his inspection problem to a set of well-defined image-mappable and hardware-based tasks( Functional Representation Query System - FRQS). 
- Automatic recommendation of image interpretation systems using knowledge bases on both previous inspection systems as well as on algorithm performance (Intelligent Application Mapper - IAM). 
- Facilities for the developer to experiment with algorithm chaining in an interactive environment (Interactive Computing Environment - ICE)

These sectors need large-scale information servers supporting (extended) Relational Database (RDB) technology. EDS can be introduced into customer installations as an accelerator to give an order of magnitude improvement in the cost/performance ratio of existing applications. The development of the database extensions and the support of Lisp and Prolog will give EDS the capability of extending the functionality of applications.
This project addresses the needs of leading commercial users of information technology who are seeing information volumes growing by 30% to 40% annually. The use of that information is also increasing rapidly with more complex application systems as well as the more traditional, fine grained database transactions.
Relational database technology has become established as the key strategic business requirement of the 1990s and beyond. The functionality and interfaces of relational systems will evolve with time.

The European declarative system (EDS) is targeted at those who need large scale information servers supporting relational database (RDB) technology.
The project will result in the design of a large scale distributed store parallel processing system including a RDB subsystem, Lisp and Prolog language subsystems and a Unix kernel operating system.

Most of the technologies and EDS components have already been developed. It is expected that by the end of 1992, several fully integrated EDS prototype systems, each supporting different large commercial applications, will have been developed. EDS is designed as a high performance back end information server. It can be connected to the back ends of various mainframes from Bull, ICL and the Siemens. High performance is achieved by exploiting parallelizm using a shared nothing computer (up to 256 processors), and by reducing data access latency using large main memory storage (up to 2 gigabytes per PE) to hold the entire database in memory at processing time.

In practice, the EDS project involves the design and implementation of a parallel hardware machine and a parallel machine executive, EMEX, to support the EDS parallel database base management system (DBMS). Moreover, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) programming languages subsystems (parallel LISP and Elipsys, parallel logic programming system) are supported in EDS. Coupling these languages with the EDS DBMS advanced information processing systems (eg knowledge bases) could be developed. This is demonstrated by a number of commercial applications implemented in the project.

System complexity is growing and hence local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) connections are being used more intensively: this increased complexity needs support. The tools for object based integrated administrative systems (TOBIAS) project aimed to develop a common methodology based on an object oriented model and to define and implement a workbench to support system and management activities.
The workbench is a set of integrated and portable tools aimed at helping and simplifying the administration of a large number of heterogeneous machines and networks. The use of an object oriented approach allows a uniform description, in abstract terms, of facilities, equipment, operations and human machine interactions without specifying organizational solution or connectivity details. TOBIAS is implemented on top of the Unix and portable common tool environment (PCTE) systems, but is not dependent on these environments and is open to integration with existing commerical products. Considerable efficiency improvements are achieved by using TOBIAS system administrators to deal with complex distributed systems and the overall dependabiltity of system management processes is enhanced. The system management domain represents a significant market, as yet completely unexplored. New and advanced technologies (eg the object-oriented approach, graphics facilities) are used to increase the capacity of system managers to manage and control the hardware and software components of hundreds of interconnected computers.

The results of the work will also lead to:

reductions in system administration time and management costs, leading to increased competitiveness;
reductions in the skill and experience required of the system manager, due to the use of a uniform, platform independent user interface.

The purpose of MONOFAST is to advance the state of the art in the design and fabrication of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) towards higher operating frequencies.

The aim of the MONOFAST project is to develop a yield driven processing technology which will enable the design and construction of low noise amplifiers operating at 44 GHz. Both active and passive components are critical for the operation of these types of millimetre wave circuits, which will be based on coplanar waveguide (CPW) construction. As little is known about the design of CPW circuits, part of the work programme is concerned with the development of design methodologies for this interconnect technology.

Process and component design are being iteratively refined using reverse device engineering to converge towards a process technology capable of giving an acceptable yield in any future exploitation of the research field effect transistors (FET) with 0.2 micron T gates exhibiting performances close to the state of the art have been realised. The experimental and theoretical results already obtained concerning the coplanar passive waveguide elements are very interesting.
The technologies and components needed to obtain high performance and worthwhile yields from monolithic circuits working at the frequencies proposed lie at or beyond the present state of the art for two reasons. Firstly, the fabrication tolerances needed to contain device performance spreads within acceptable limits are severe, and are unattainable or exceptionally difficult to achieve using conventional integration processes. Secondly, circuit architectures must change: in particular, it is desirable to design around coplanar waveguide interconnections to minimise parasitic inductances and to allow dimensional flexibility whilst preserving characteristic impedance. The aim of the MONOFAST project was to develop a yield-driven processing technology to enable the design and construction of low-noise amplifiers operating at 44 GHz. Both active and passive components are critical for the operation of these types of millimetre-wave circuits, which were based on coplanar waveguide (CPW) construction. 

As little was known about the design of CPW circuits, part of the work-programme was concerned with the development of design methodologies for this interconnect technology. The active devices were choosen to be T-gate MESFETs fabricated on material grown by MBE, although the technologies developed were intended to be readily applicable to HEMTs. High-resolution electron-beam and ion-beam lithographic methods were planned to be employed for pattern delineation, and dry etching was to be developed for forming recesses and to meet other etching needs.

8259;3280;NANA;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Novel Parallel Algorithms for New Real-Time VLSI Architectures;01/05/1989;29/02/1992;;"The NANA Action aimed to develop new parallel real-time VLSI architectures for a large variety of applications, such as image and seismic processing, robotics, video, telecommunications, factory automation, biomedical technology and adaptive beam forming.The most important classes of techniques needed in these domains are algebraic and numerical techniques for multidimensional problems and their application as subsystems in other algorithms. 
To allow for the future design of high-complexity applications in mega-chip technologies, synthesis techniques starting from very high-level behavioural descriptions are crucial. Research includes the exploration of novel methodologies in this area. Efforts pursued in NANA2 (6632) also include part of the implementation in software tools.
Novel very large scale integration (VLSI) architectures and parallel algorithms were developed for multidimensional signal processing (MDSP), which is used in image processing, graphics and system control. These algorithms and architectures are needed in real-time systems and will have a beneficial impact on computer-aided hardware design and synthesis environments. Novel parallel algorithmic kernels were investigated. In particular, effort was spent on parallel algorithms for linear algebra system solvers and path problems, adaptive signal processing and adaptive control applications such as beam forming and parameter estimation, and large scale modelling of partial differential equations, all leading to more efficient systolic and single instruction multiple data (SIMD) realizations. In addition, graphics processing related kernel-like efficient radiosity derivation, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, segmentation and visualization have been tackled. New parallel architectural styles and methodologies have been investigated. Work concentrated on: efficient control/data flow models and algorithmic transformations for realizing the multi-dimentional data in both regular and irregular real-time signal processing algorithms in an effective way on memory organisations; semantics-preserving transformative methods for systolic arrays with emphasis on global operation and semi-systolic or piecewise regular architectures; and an extended data model and clustering/partitioning methods for array synthesis.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The work has been divided into two areas: 
1.Novel Parallel Algorithms. Past experience has demonstrated that putting effort into the algorithm is essential for the success of a design, as most classical algorithms are implicitly tailored to sequential processing. For this reason a number of repr esentative algorithms in the domain of MDSP will be analysed in order to develop different, more parallel, algorithms. 
2.Architectural Methodologies. Classical solutions, such as general-purpose standard machines, are too wasteful in terms of area-cost and power dissipation for a given throughput. Moreover, the communication and memory size bottlenecks are not removed. I n order to alleviate these shortcomings, fundamental breakthroughs are needed in novel algorithm development and high-level application- or domain-specific VLSI components. To achieve this, efficient target architectural styles have been defined, including regular arrays and application-specific data-flow dominated processors. The emphasis in NANA 2 lies on the architectural methodologies and the environment to synthesise such parallel architectures from high level behavioural descriptions are investigated. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Results have been produced in terms of novel parallel algorithms and architecture methodologies and their impact on synthesis strategies and environments which are efficient in terms of chip-area and off-chip memory and which comply with the throughput, power and pin-count limitations of VLSI based realisations. 
The main focus of the Action in the first work area has been the investigation of novel parallel algorithmic kernels. In particular, effort has been spent recently on parallel algorithms for linear algebra system solvers and path problems, adaptive signalprocessing and adaptive control applications such as beamforming and parameter estimation, and large scale modeling of Partial Differential Equations, all leading to more efficient systolic and SIMD realisations. In addition, graphics processing relatedkernel like efficient radiosity derivation, 3D image reconstruction, segmentation and visualization have been tackled. 
In the second area of work, new parallel architectural styles and methodologies have been investigated for application to the type of problems addressed in the first work-package. Work concentrated on: efficient control/data flow models and algorithmic transformations for realizing the multi-dimensional data in both regular and irregular real-time signal processing algorithms in an effective way on memory organisations; semantics preserving transformative methods for systolic arrays with emphasis on global operation and semi-systolic or piece-wise regular architectures; and an extended data model and clustering/partitioning methods for array synthesis. 
In addition, a considerable cooperative effort has been put into holding common workshops in order to discuss information from work at the partner sites in order to arrive at the 19 common deliverables which have been produced at the end of NANA. New workshops are planned in the context of NANA2 (6632). 
POTENTIAL

Formal methods make automation possible, and automation makes formal methods amenable to human use.  This twin emphasis on formal methods and maximum automation is applied throughout the project.  The centre of the project is a common mathematical model.  This allows the elimination of some manual language transformations during the software life-cycle and supports design transformations.

The project was based on the use of formal methods which make automation possible, and automation makes formal methods amenable to human use. This twin emphasis on formal methods and maximum automation was applied throughout the research which was centred on a common mathematical model. This allows the elimination of some manual language transformations during the software life cycle and supports design transformations.

The main achievements of the research are:

The development of a methodology and architecture for handling specifications to reduce as much as possible the discountinuities within the software transformation process;
the realization of convergence within a programming infrastructure;
methods and methodology covering the following topics:
understanding of informal requirements or specifications;
generation of formal specifications;

design and generation of code;

online interface;

an integrated prototype to support the pilot use study.
Technical Approach  

Methodology interfaces and functions are demonstrated through prototype implementations applied to real examples derived from other RACE tasks.  Demonstration of results (methods, interfaces, functions and techniques demonstrated in the project) is being carried out in collaboration with other projects involved in programming infrastructure (PI) integration.  It is envisaged that these can also be used as the basis of commercially- supported environments, and applied to IBC systems by the mid 1990s.  

All of the specified functions of SPECS are grouped into a single, unifying architecture, based on existing standard specification languages (SDL, LOTOS).  This is the enabling idea for automating to the maximum degree, the creation and handling of product quality code.  SPECS allows maximum use of verification functions to improve greatly the quality of the software. The SPECS methodology and techniques support the object oriented design of software. The formal basis of the software can also be used for subsequent software reuse and modification, even of an installed software base.  

Key Issues  

- Wide ranging expertise within the project  
- Co-ordination of activities across all projects  
- Common semantic model  

Achievements  

The main achievements of the work done up to December 1991 are:  

- Development of a methodology and architecture for handling specifications to reduce as much as possible the discontinuities within the software transformation process.  Both goals have been reached through the delivery of SPECS Methodology and Architecture, the initial version of which has been demonstrated and further validated / enhanced by several model examples.  
- Realisation of convergence within the programming infrastructure activity of RACE.  The internal work done by each PI project and synthesised during common meetings is producing consensus on the recommended class of infrastructures and common practice recommendations (CPRs) for programming.  
- Methods and methodology covering the following topics: understanding of informal requirements or specifications, generation of formal specifications, refinement and analysis of formal specifications, design and generation of code, components for reuse, and test and certification of software components and systems.  
- Methods and tools have been implemented in the following areas: informal specification handling and formal specification generation, formal specification handling with emphasis on specifications in SDL and LOTOS, common semantics analysis, simulation and execution of specifications, on-line interface.  
- The integrated prototype supports the pilot use study in 1992 and therefore allows evaluation of the SPECS approach.  The prototype will be enhanced before the end of the project.  

The results of the work have a clear focus on the needs of IBC designers, who may be working at different levels of abstraction.  The range of prospective users of the SPECS results are quite well represented by the partners within the SPECS project.  Thus the project team has been able to develop a clearer appreciation of the effectiveness of formal methods.  

Expected Impact  

The set of methods developed by SPECS has been moulded specifically to the needs of IBC software development and support.  They are available within the Community as a basis for adaptation to specific industrial environments. Feedback to standards bodies such as CCITT and ISO has already taken place especially in the area of methodology and object orientation of SDL and LOTOS.  

To support a full technology transfer to Europe's software industry, a briefing and a book summarising the SPECS approach are planned for the end of 1992.  Detailed project results are available as reports from the prime contractor: GSI-TECSI.

CLICS aimed to take recent developments in category theory and the categorical approach to logic and apply them in a number of important areas in computing science, namely: 
-type theory 
-domain theory and the semantics of programming languages 
-logics of computable functions 
-logics and models for parallel computation 
-unified theories of specification. 
The CLICS Action also aimed to produce a supply of computing science research workers who have a thorough grounding in categorical methods.
The concepts and techniques of category theory and categorical logic in computer science (CLICS) were applied to a number of key areas in computing science, including the study of type structures for programming languages; the development of structuring principles and axiomatic frameworks for semantics as a basis for computational logics; and unified treatments of logics and models for parallel computation, and of specification formalizms.

The 4 major areas of activity are as follows:
synthetic domain theory (a new foundation for denotational semantics in which computational domains can be viewed as sets within a constructive universe and the semantic characterization of sequentiality in higher order languages);
semantics and logics of computation (structuring denotational semantics using computational monads with the possibility of developing large semantic specifications incrementally and sematics of subtyping in combination with recursive types and polymorphism);
concurrency and linear logic adjunctions between various categories of models, Girard's linear logic focussing on computational interpretations of the logic and connections with process calculi the development of a version of the Curry-Howard isomorphism for processes of comparable utility);
type theory and constructive mathematics extracting the computational content of classical proofs using the framework of point free topology and a geometric paradigm for symbolic computation, based on Penrose diagrams, which offer a more concise and intuitive framework for many complex symbolic calculations).

-Pursue a deeper understanding of type structures for programming languages. 
-Produce systematic accounts of denotational, operational and axiomatic semantics for programming languages, emphasising structuring principles and axiomatic frameworks for semantics, in order to provide a foundation for logics of computable functions.-Develop logics for computable functions which exploit constructivity and categorical logic to provide a better match between the logics and the computational concepts being modelled. Conceptual sophistication in the foundations is expected to lead to aradical simplification in the reasoning inside the problem domain (eg. by working inside the effective topos, naive (albeit constructive) set-theoretic reasoning about higher-order polymorphism can be used, whereas in classical set theory this is actuallyinconsistent). 
-Develop a framework in which to unify the highly diverse and superficially disparate work in the fields of logics and models of parallel computation, and unified theories of specification. This is essential if different programming and specification par adigms are to be successfully integrated, and if truly fundamental and enduring concepts are to emerge. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
There have been four major areas of activity within the Action: 
-Synthetic Domain Theory: major progress has been made in this new foundation for denotational semantics, in which computational domains can be viewed as sets within a constructive universe. The viability of this theory as a basis for denotational semant ics and program logics has now been established. Major advances have also been made in the semantic characterisation of sequentiality in higher-order languages. 
-Semantics and Logics of Computation, where a key role has been played by Moggi's work on structuring denotational semantics using computational monads. This opens the possibility of developing large semantic specifications incrementally. Recent developm ents in program logics aim to extend the elegance and generality of LCF-like logics to a wider class of computational paradigms. Considerable progress in the semantics of subtyping in combination with recursive types and polymorphism has been made. 
-Concurrency and Linear Logic. The development of a unified approach to concurrency in a categorical framework by studying adjunctions between various categories of models, and work on Girard's Linear Logic, focussing on computational interpretations ofthe logic and connections with process calculi, have been two major areas of activity. A major goal is the development of a version of the Curry-Howard isomorphism for processes of comparable utility to that for functional calculi. A general framework forLinear Realisability has been developed. 
-Type Theory and Constructive Mathematics. Much progress has been made on extracting the computational content of classical proofs, using the framework of point-free topology. There has also been work on a new, more geometric paradigm for symbolic comput ation, based on Penrose diagrams, which offer a more concise and intuitive framework for many complex symbolic calculations.

The QLIS project will concentrate on: 

- ensuring that the quality-of-life issues that arise through the use of IT applications in the home and at work are made explicit, so that they can be taken into account in the design and development of new IT products as well as in the management of new IT-in-use 
- developing software scenario models for the assessment and forecasting of the implications of IT applications for quality-of-life issues 
- promoting a greater awareness of quality-of-life issues among relevant groups, particularly the IT industry, user organisations, political groups and other interested parties. 

The main project objectives are to: 

- Design and develop support tools for the generation of Software Scenarios regarding the likely impact of new IT applications on the quality of life in the home and at work. 
- Develop at least one example scenario of the implications on the quality of life of a specific IT application in the home and work environment. 
- Formulate and refine a Generic Reference Framework (GRF) which will enable the conceptualisation for assessment and evaluation of the implications of specific IT applications on the quality of life. 
- Disseminate information about the main results of the QLIS project and to promote awareness and debate about quality-of-life issues. 

The software scenario support tool will provide the European IT industry with a means for forecasting the quality-of-life implications of their IT products prior to the actual diffusion of these in the marketplace. The results of such scenarios will be integrated into the IT product design and development cycle. 

The results of the QLIS project will help to ensure that the development and application of advanced IT is used to enhance the quality of life of individuals in the areas mentioned above. This will be useful for the variety of decision-makers concerned with the long-term implications of IT, and especially useful for agents responsible for designing and diffusing new IT products and for users and specialists responsible for designing and managing new IT-in-use systems.

An architecture has been developed for an intelligent simulation learning environment. A set of specifications has also been defined for a common authoring environment which can integrate authoring tools from different sources.
 Many institutes and companies in Europe are working on authoring facilities. This effort is, however, very fragmented, what results in duplication of work and a lack of interoperability between the outcomes. 

The project in the Exploratory Action is limited to first steps towards standardisation of facilities and datastructures and to defining how state-of-the-art Information Technology and Instructional Technology can be merged to develop sophisticated authoring facilities. The main outcomes will be the definition of a Open System for Instructional Design (OS- ID) and functional designs of authoring facilities to be embedded in this OS-ID, OS-ID will provide crucial input for PETE (Portable Educational Tool Environment). 

Two potentially very important types of Open Learning Material will be investigated in detail (simulation-based and hypermedia-based), partly in respect to their learning potential but mainly in respect to their specific development problems. In parallel to these two subprojects, several crucial aspects of the authoring process will be addressed in dedicated groups (e.g. subject matter analysis, courseware engineering, design databases, user interfaces). These groups are not restricted to any type of learning material but will investigate how these aspects of authoring can be supported by sophisticated tools. Furthermore they function as a discussion platform on detailed aspects, both within the project and to other European projects.

Such an environment should include a language suitable for databases, programming and problem-solving together with logic-based tools for incremental development (including integrity checking and program transformation), as well as for assembling new knowledge bases from existing ones.
A range of logic based computer languages and associated development tools were developed. The lanuages extend logic programming by incorporating features from computer algebra, deductive databases, artificial intelligence and mathematical logic. The development tools include integrity checking, belief revision, metaprogramming, and program transformation.

Progress has been made in the following areas:
language extensions (several numerical problems previously unsolved by computer algebra techniques alone have been solved by Prolog III, and several previously open complexity problems have been solved for structured typed languages);
knowledge assimilation (previously disconnected methods for view updates, belief revision, default reasoning and abduction have been shown to be closely connected and logic programs have been extended to include both explicit and implicit negation);
metalevel reasoning (the first steps have been taken to clarify the semantics of different ways of combining object languages and metalanguages in logic programming and a programming language, Goedel, with declarative metaprogramming facilities has been defined);
program development, analysis and transformation (connections have been found between program transformation methods using specialisation of metainterpreters, compiling control, and proofs as programs).

A number of new research opportunities have also been identified involving the possiblity of developing object oriented deductive databases using the work on structured types. Links between theory construction techniques and the transformation of rules and exceptions into ordinary logic programs have been identified, as well as links between inductive proof methods used in proof plans and the methods used in program transformation and in program derivation by integrity checking.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
To improve knowledge representation and problem-solving power, a number of extensions of logic programming were developed. These include the use of constraints, structured types, hypothetical reasoning, and meta-level reasoning. 
The techniques of knowledge assimilation, meta-level reasoning and of program analysis and transformation are being advanced to improve the development and maintenance of programs, databases, and knowledge represented as extended logic programs.

Specifically this project will address the questions to which extent humic substances: contribute directly to acidification; interact with other dissolved materials; and directly influence aquatic biota. 

The research will cover investigations on acidification processes, the effects of acid precipitation on soil minerals and soil organic matter as well as on the amounts of deliberated solutes from catchment soils into the surface waters. 

The role of HS in the acidification processes of aquatic ecosystems and its effect on aquatic biota will be studied through a large scale field experiment with whole catchment manipulation. In this international experiment, called HUMEX project, one half of a dystrophic lake and the corresponding catchment will be artificially acidified with water from a nearby lake (naturally low in salts and organic matter). The lake is divided by a water tight curtain from the other half which is serving as the unacidified control. 

Detailed studies will include : 
soil water in the catchment; 
surface and groundwater entering into the lake; 
chemical composition of lake water and of outflow water in particular regarding HS in the water column and in sediments; 
microbial decomposition of detritus, nutrient (phosphorous and iron) availability in dystrophic water in relation to acidification and HS;

8257;3247;DESON;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Disorder and Electrical Properties in Silicon Oxynitrides;01/08/1989;31/01/1992;;"The amorphous state of insulating silicon oxynitride allows the synthesis of materials with a band gap that can be tailored continuously. The DESON Action aimed to provide the basis for new intermetallisation techniques by performing an in-depth study on insulating SiOxNyHz thin films. A complete set of experiments on samples of the same run have been  performed. This gives a precise description of the amorphous network and enables the correlation of structural and chemical characteristics with the electronic and electrical properties.
The electrical properties of thin-film insulating amorphous (non-crystalline) silicon oxynitrides SiOxNyHz were investigated. Samples of this material with varying composition (varying x, y and z) have been prepared, the structural, electrical and optical properties of the films measured, and the correlations between these properties studied. In addition, a theoretical model of the phonon and electronic densities was developed. The basis of new intermetallization techniques in very large scale integration (VLSI) technology is provided. A structure more chemically ordered than the RBM model for the silicon-oxygen and silicon-nitrogen bonds is probable for the medium range silicon oxynitrides. The hydrogen incorporation is also determined by a chemical ordering thermodynamic process instead of by a bond formation at random. The dangling bond formation is correlated with the appearance of local chemical configuration out of chemical equilibrium in the network. In the silicon oxynitride, the electric properties are not correlated to the disorder in the sense of distance and bond angles fluctuations in an amorphous network described with a RBM model, but are principally correlated with the occurence of anomalous chemical local configuration in the layer. The creation of these anomalous local chemical configurations may be strongly dependent upon the plasma chemistry and on the plasma technological parameters. It has not been possible to predict the physical and electronic properties of disordered materials from a unique general law.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
SiOxNyHz insulating amorphous thin films (30-400 nm) were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (SiH4, N2O and NH3 with and without helium dilution of gases). The preparation parameters were fixed to avoid significant densities of Si-Si bonds. Sets of various SiOxNyHz compositions between Si3N4 and SiO2 were prepared by changing the N2O / (N2O\NH3) gas-flow ratio. The influence of the thickness at layers of a fixed composition was also studied. 
The refractive index and thickness were obtained from ellipsometry. The mechanical stress and step coverage were investigated. The atomic density profiles were measured by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection. The chemical bonding was studied by infrared spectroscopy. The optical gap was obtained from UV optical absorption. The structural disorder was studied by X-ray grazing incident angle diffraction. The structural defects were observed by dark and light electron-spin resonance. The relative dielectric constant, positive fixed-charge density and interface state density were obtained by high-frequency and quasi-static capacitance-voltage measurements. The breakdown strength and conduction mechanism were obtained from current-voltage measurements. 
The properties of these amorphous thin films were determined and their dependence on thickness and He dilution explored. The correlation between the network organisation and the electrical properties were proposed. The equilibrium configurations and the electronic and vibrational structures of SiOx and SiNy (respectively) were calculated as a function of oxygen or nitrogen concentration. The effect of hydrogen incorporation on the atomic arrangement and the electronic and vibrational structures were computed. The electronic structure and gap energy calculations were extended to SiOxNy and compared with experimental results. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-For O/O\N increasing from 0 to 1 in SiOxNyHz, the atomic percentages vary as follows: Si is constant around 25%; O increases almost linearly from 0 to 65%; N decreases linearly from 50% to 2%; H is constant at 25% for O/(O\N) <0.4 and decreases for O/(O \N) >0.4; the total atomic density decreases from 1023 cm-3 to 7 x 1022/cm-3. H is mainly present in N-H bonds for O/(O\N) below 0.6, while the Si-H and O-H bond densities remain very low. For O/(O\N) >0.6, H is present in N-H and O-H bonds. The calculated Si-Si bond density is negative, suggesting that if Si-Si bonds exist, their density is very low. 
-With the same deposition parameters, the macroscopic composition of silicon oxynitrides obtained with the same gas ratios are not modified by the type of reactor, the deposition rate, the layer thickness or the helium dilution. 
-The important chemical ordering occuring at O/(O\N)=0.4 induces physical property changes at this composition for the type of H incorporation, the stress, the band gap, and the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. 
-The stress on c-Si is compressive at all compositions, with a minimum around 0.1 GPa for O/(O\N) around 0.6. 
-The optical Tauc gap is at the nitride value of 5.4 eV for O/(O\N) <0.4 and then increases up to 9 eV. This result does not depend on the sample thickness. The computed energy gap as a function of O/(O\N) is in agreement with the experimental curve, esp ecially in the change of slope around O/(O\N)=0.4. Calculations established that the absorption steps observed between 7 and 8 eV for 0.7<O/(O\N)<0.95 were coming from the N 2p lone pairs. 
-In addition to the Si dangling bonds always observed in the silicon oxynitrides (Si DB), nitrogen dangling bonds (N DB) are observed for O/(O\N)=0.4 and oxygen NBOH dangling bonds are detected near SiO2. The electrical conduction Poole-Frenkel mechanism through the insulating layer involves the nitrogen dangling bond in the nitrogen rich silicon oxynitride (O/(O\N)<0.4), while the Fowler-Nordheim process involves the silicon dangling bonds in the oxygen-rich silicon oxynitrides (O/(O\N)>0.4). 
-The positive fixed charges measured at the c-Si interface are correlated with the Si DB point defects in the layers, while the N DB are only involved in the experiments with electric stress leading to strong charge injection processes. 
-The helium dilution does not change the physical properties at the atomic scale very much and has little effects at the defect scale. It does not improve the electrical properties, as was claimed previously by other authors. 
-A structure more chemically ordered than the RBM model for the Si-O and Si-N bonds is probable for the medium range silicon oxynitrides. The hydrogen incorporation is also determined by a chemical ordering thermodynamic process instead of by a bond form ation at random. The dangling bond formation is correlated with the appearance of local chemical configuration out of chemical equilibrium in the network. 
-In the silicon oxynitride, the electric properties are not correlated to the disorder in the sense of distance and bond angles fluctuations in an amorphous network described with a RBM model, but are principally correlated with the occurence of anomalou s chemical local configuration in the layer. The creation of these anomalous local chemical configurations may be strongly dependent upon the plasma chemistry and on the plasma technological parameters. We are not able to predict the physical and electronic properties of disordered materials from a unique general law. The experimental and technological approaches, 'trying and measuring', remain at the present time the unavoidable channel. 
POTENTIAL 
Understanding the behaviour of amorphous films will enable them to be used in a wide variety of applications in the field of VLSI technology. For example, in the low-temperature fabrication of devices, these films can be used for the intermetallisation or the final passivation layer, and as constituent of memory devices. The silicon oxynitrides may be used in chemical ISFETs sensors as sensitive surface to the pH or as intermediate thin layers on SiO2 allowing the grafting of various ionic sensitive molec ules. In the field of integrated opto-electronic systems or waveguide applications, the silicon oxynitrides are ideal candidates because of their tunable refractive indexes between 1.46 and 2.0.";;;;;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;FR;"Université de Montpellier II (Université des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc);UNIVERSITEIT VAN UTRECHT;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"FR;NL;ES;BE";

The copyright in transmitted electronic documents (CITED) project is based on the needs of the information industry in Europe to safeguard copyright material stored and transmitted in digital form. An in depth user survey has been carried out in consultation with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and most of the relevant standardization bodies, with particular reference to the problems introduced by digital technology. This was supplemented by a detailed comparative study of the current and developing legal position on a country/topic basis. Based on the User Functional Requirement Survey (UFRS), CITED built a generic model applicable to the different business domains. The model considers that copyright protection has to integrate the information actor chain as a whole, to protect primary as well as the secondary information, to secure mass production processes, to be as transparent as possible with the existing processes, to be applicable in any European Community country in conformity with national copyright legislation, and to be sufficiently flexible regarding the business strategies of the information makers and users.
The model defines distributed components that will be transparently located at the user level, at the information system level and wherever there is a relationship among the users, the distribution system and the information system, and provides countermeasures to various piracy acts. The model is implemented and tested for 2 demonstrators, which embody the distributed components in specified environments within the information industry. From the demonstrators, hardware and software products will be developed. The first demonstrator is based on an online system for supplying downloaded document images from a digital store (ADONIS), and is designed to demonstrate in practical form the control of a user's ability to utilize these images. The second demonstrator is developed in the field of digital audio recording (DAT) to study t he very different technical and commercial situation where information is transmitted on a physical carrier to a large general public.
CITED is concerned with the expansion of the committed information to digital storage, which is currently severely restricted by fears on the part of the copyright owners that they will loose effective control over their intellectual property. This fear severely curtails the commercial exploitation of copyrighted informations. 

CITED aims to cover the needs of both users and information providers across the areas of software, data/databases, information bases, electronic publishing, video/TV, and audio recording.

Format specifications for the transfer of data between computer aided design (CAD) systems have been drawn up and standards set. Software for reading, writing, handling, converting and checking data has been written and microprocessors developed.

Five application protocols have been instituted, for manifold solid boundary representation models, surface models, wireframe models, compound boundary representation models and constructive solid geometry models. The first 3 have been forwarded to the International Standards Organization (ISO) to become part of the standard ISO 10303 (STEP).

Processors for the transfer of data have been developed by each CAD vendor in the project for their own CAD system. The processors communicate on one side with the standardized data files, and on the other with the native data repositories.
The project will continue the work of ESPRIT project 322, which led directly to the STEP standard. 

A subset of STEP covering 3-D design will be defined and tested by prototype processors. All these processors are based on one set of COMMON TOOLS including a 'Data Structure', a 'Scanner/Parser', a 'Conversion Toolset', a Formatter' and some 'Statistics'. The processors support five official application protocols: 

- wireframe geometry, ISO 10303 part 206 
- surface geometry, ISO 10303 part 205 
- boundary-represented geometry, ISO 10303 part 206

Technical Approach  

To begin phase 2 of the project, detailed specifications for broadband network experiments in the MANGUALDE (Portugal) and EPIRUS (Greece) areas are being developed. These are mainly focused on the extension of fibre deployment as close to user premises as possible and on integrating existent telephone services with television. The study will take into account similar experiences in other areas of Europe and the USA.  The strategy of REVOLVE for both areas EPIRUS and MANGUALDE is based on:

Key Issue  

REVOLVE addresses questions of IBC realisation and European network evolution from the view point of EC Member States containing major LFRs, ie Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Northern Ireland (UK), the 'Mezzogiorno' Region of Italy and the Highlands and Islands Region of Scotland(UK).  More than one fourth of the total EC population lives in these LFRs.  

Achievements  

During phase I of the project, a set of evolution scenarios most likely to be implemented within LFRs were identified and assessed.  This included the impact of mobile and satellite technologies on LFRs, and conversely, how such systems might best be configured to take account of the needs of LFRs.  

REVOLVE developed a network design computer tool named GRAPHITE which has since been used in RACE projects ATD (R1022) and ADVANCE (R1009).  The main conclusions of REVOLVE will be published in two books: Europe Connected or Disconnected? Broadband Networks in Less Developed Regions, and A Network Planner's Reference Guide.  

The first results from phase II of the project followed a series of visits to European broadband experiments, to understand the technical and applications solutions under trial.  During this phase the project has a specific task to investigate possible funding options.  Details on the various EC options that are available (LEADER, ORA, TELEMATIQUE, RACE and the European Investment Bank) have been documented, and as a result, the partners conducting experiments have submitted proposals for funding.  

Local platforms have already been established in EPIRUS and MANGUALDE supporting future introduction of services, information gathering, and real cooperation on the specification of possible applications.  Business plans for both areas are being  developed, with equipment manufacturers helping in the specification of feasible solutions.  

Expected Impact  

Tools developed by REVOLVE will help strategic planners in those countries having rural populations to consider, thereby contributing significantly to integrated development of IBC in Europe.  The specification of trial broadband networks for the EPIRUS and MANGUALDE areas are to be supported by specific business plans prepared by the project.  To this extent, the project seeks to provide justification for national and EC investment to extend IBC to LFRs.";;;;;Centro de Estudios de Telecomunicacoes;PT;"BROADCOM Eireann Research LTD;Analysys Ltd;Hellenic PTT Consulting Org (OTE)/(ESTTO);Nexus Europe (SUS Research);Telefonica de Espana SA / Fundesco;Centro Studi e Applicazioni in Tecnologie Avanzate Tecnopolis Csata";"IE;UK;EL;ES;IT";

8264;3299;COMPUGRAPH;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Computing by Graph Transformation;01/03/1989;29/02/1992;;"Graphs are used to model a large variety of important concepts, such as lay-outs and networks, expressions, relations and  programs. A computational model arises when the replacement of fixed substructures of a graph by others is allowed - a graph transformation. The goal of the COMPUGRAPH working group was to demonstrate that graph transformation can provide a unifying framework for many aspects of computer science, and that the whole process of software production can be formally described in this framework. 
The most important schools for graph grammars and graph transformation are currently located in Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Italy. COMPUGRAPH brought together researchers from these schools and enabled joint work and intensive cooperation. Research identified the common aspects and foundations of the different approaches, and worked on applications in case-studies.
The basic approaches of graph transformation are combined and unified. The resulting formalism will be applicable as a formal method in software engineering, as a model for distributed algorithms, as a tool for complexity analysis, and as a computational model for parallel systems. Potential applications are investigated in functional and logic programming, databases, knowledge representation, and formal reasoning. Work focused on specification, programming, and implementations based on graph transformation, together with the computational models and the algorithms required to implement such transformations.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Graph transformation generalises tree rewriting, the theoretical basis for functional and logic programming methods. In contrast to tree rewriting, this generalisation also allows the modelling of the efficiency aspects of current programming techniques. It is therefore possible to capture all relevant aspects of the software production cycle in the graph transformation model. 
In order to work towards this, two subgoals have been defined: 
1.The existing theories about, and approaches to graph transformation needed to be compared and, as much as possible, unified 
2.The usefulness and practicality of computing by graph transformation needs to be demonstrated by work in three specific areas: 
a.Concurrent computing, where graph transformation can serve as a model for concurrency, as concurrent modification steps are allowed. 
b.Execution of algebraic specifications. 
c.Efficient graph algorithms, which are necessary to demonstrate that graph transformation can itself be implemented efficiently. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The following results have been obtained: 
1.A comparative study of most graph transformation approaches explored by the Working Group. Several papers have addressed questions of unification and generalisation for context-free as well as general rewriting. 
2.Graph grammar models for actor systems, logic programs and concurrent constrained programming which allow 'True Concurrency' aspects in all of these formalisms to be investigated on a unified basis. A graph-grammar-based notion of abstract transformati on system has been developed that generalises Petri-nets and graph grammars for relational structures. 
3.A new graph-grammar based approach, 'jungle evaluation', for the evaluation of expressions with shared substructures; and a theoretical framework for the execution of algebraic specifications by graph transformation systems, which shows that graph tran sformation can help if the programming of large applications is viewed as a rule-based activity. 
4.Although many relevant properties of graphs are not efficiently decidable for arbitrary graphs, it was shown that many of these can be efficiently decided for classes of graphs which are generated by graph grammars; this implies that although computati on on some graphs may be expensive, the graphs occurring in transformation systems can be processed efficiently. 
POTENTIAL 
The COMPUGRAPH working group has provided comparative studies of different approaches and case studies that demonstrate the usefulness of graph transformation as a fundamental computing model. These results can serve as a basis for a future research and development project within ESPRIT, which might also address concrete implementations of graph rewriting and corresponding proof and development tools.";;;;;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT BERLIN;DE;"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT BERLIN;Università degli Studi di Pisa;RIJKS UNIVERSITEIT LEIDEN;Université de Bordeaux I;UNIVERSITAET BREMEN";"DE;IT;NL;FR";
8238;3017;NOISE;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Electrical Fluctuations and Noise in Advanced Microelectronics: Submicron, 2-D Gas and Low-Temperature Devices;01/06/1989;29/02/1992;;"The aims of the NOISE Action were to: 
-identify limitations of performance caused by noise in complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), HEMT, and other technologies 
-correlate noise phenomena and the quality and reliability of the devices 
-characterise the reliability of a device by the temporal evolution of its noise (due to ageing, influence of radiation, etc) 
-identify noise sources 
-extend existing CAD programs for the design of microelectronic systems by incorporating noise models.
Electrical fluctuations and noise in silicon and more advanced submicron devices were studied. Noise sources and the relationships between noise and device characteristics were examined, with special attention to device quality and reliability and performance limitations. Computer aided design (CAD) programs were extended by incorporating noise models.

Progress has been made in the following areas:
low temperature working between 4.2 and 200 K (the observed increase in noise could be explained by known low temperature effects and at very low temperatures various instabilities were observed with ageing of metal oxide semiconductor transistors (MOST) accelerated by cooling);
miniaturization and noise in metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) low frequency noise generally followed the scaling down which provoked an increase not only of the noise but also of the dispersion of its level among devices and ageing was accelerated with the miniaturization);
random telegraph signals (RTS) in MOSFETs. (the emergence of RTS noise was favoured by miniaturization and a limit of the cooling down existed beyond which it was impossible to predict with certainty the level of low frequency noise of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor);
noise and defectiveness (noise can be used as an efficient characterization tool used in conjunction with the usual macroscopic measurements and the density of oxide traps could be extracted from the noise level and it can be correlated to the density of fast interface traps);
noise and technology in MOSFETs (the gate oxide thickness has no particular influence but lightly doped drain (LDD) is of significance for small devices which is also valid for the local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) isolation and in MOSFETs on separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX) it is now also possible to separate the front and back interface contributions as well as noise due to the bulk);
noise models (noise in mesoscopic devices h as been modelled, and a unified formulation of Nyquist and Schottky noise pictures found).
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach taken was to: 
-fabricate devices: two types will be used, submicronic MOSTs and HEMTs structures 
-measure the noise in high and low frequency domains at room temperature and low temperatures (between 4.2 K and 100 K) 
-interpret the results theoretically, by developing noise models that will be compared to general theories 
-draw conclusions about the operating limits caused by noise, with special attention paid to differences in technology. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Low-temperature working (4.2 K < T < 200 K). G-R noise (in HEMTs) and 1/f noise has been observed. The observed increase in noise could be explained by known low temperature effects (freeze out of impurities, ionisation, localisation, mobility edge etc) . At very low temperatures various instabilities are observed. Furthermore, the ageing of MOSTs is accelerated by cooling. 
-Miniaturisation and noise in MOSFETs. It has been established that (i) the low frequency noise generally follows the scaling down; (ii) the scaling down generally provokes an increase not only of the noise but also of the dispersion of its level among d evices; (iii) the ageing is accelerated with the miniaturisation. 
-Random Telegraph Signals (RTS) in MOSFETs. The emergence of random telegraph signal noise is favoured by miniaturisation. The theoretical analysis based on the most recent experimental observations shows that there exists a limit of the cooling down bey ond which it is impossible to predict with certainty the level of low frequency noise of a MOS transistor. The consequence of this uncertainty is obviously very important for the reliability and the quality of submicronic integrated circuits. 
-Noise and defectiveness. A fundamental problem arises: are the RTS the ultimate components of 1/f noise in electronic devices? For devices on III-V materials G-R noise is correlated with deep lying impurity levels. For MOSFETs, low-frequency noise highl ights the asymmetry of the degradation or the defectiveness, and does not decrease after degradation. The noise can be used as an efficient characterisation tool and can be complementary to the usual macroscopic measurements. The density of oxide traps could be extracted from the noise level and it can be correlated to the density of fast interface traps. 
-Noise and technology (MOSFETs). The gate oxide thickness (8.5 nm < delta < 120 nm) has no particular influence. Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) is of significance for small devices; the same remark is valid for the LOCOS isolation. In MOSFETs on SIMOX it is n ow also possible to separate the front and back interface contributions as well as noise due to the bulk. 
-Noise models. Noise in mesoscopic devices has been modelled, and a unified formulation of Nyquist and Schottky noise pictures found. For a degenerate 1D ballistic system it has been proved that geometrical resonances are possible whose spectral densityimplies the universal conductance G = 2e2/h. A taxonomic work of devices, for 1/f noise, following the delta-n (McWhorter) model or the delta-mu (Hooge) model has been done. For MOST, an efficient criterion of delta-mu or delta-n has been found. Insertionof noise models, for BJTs, HBTs and HEMTs in CADs is in progress. 1/f MOSTs noise models have been implemented in ST-SPICE.

At the end of the first year, a total of more than 343 or more markers (weighted value) had been distributed. During the first year 2 batches of markers were sent out, and a third batch of markers was planned for distribution to all Network laboratories. This batch consisted exclusively of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based markers, which had been selected by continuous screening of literature and the genome database (GDB). A large consignment of high quality markers were sent to all laboratories. These markers are part of the set of microsatellite markers spanning the whole human genome. The information value of these markers was extremely high, with an average heterozygosity of 79%. 

Each of the 22 network laboratories was supplied with a Unix workstation. This included a run time version of the Sybase relational database management system, together with a Sybase application called GENBASE and the version 6 CEPH database in Sybase format. In all, data on 576 markers were submitted. These corrected data are available in CRI-MAP format by anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP). 

Following the data collection phase, a process of map construction was initiated. Each Network laboratory was assigned 1 or more of the 22 autosomal chromosomes or chromosome X. Map building began in parallel with the elimination of allelic exclusions, with corrections being reported so that the data could be corrected and the CRI-MAP input files regenerated on a continuous basis. Intralocus recombinants were detected and reported back to the contributing laboratories who, in turn, fed corrections back to the central site. When complete, the CRI-MAP output files were uploaded by FTP and transformed into PostScript figures by a set of Unix scripts. The framework maps were juxtaposed with 800-band ideograms and a representative set of cytogenetic data chosen from GDB to map the relationship between the ideograms and the maps.
The European Human Gene Mapping Project (EUROGEM) is funded by the European Commission as a collaborative effort to produce a high density linkage map of the human genome. The project is organized as two centralized facilities supplying the 22 network laboratories with the necessary resources (markers and DNA) for linkage studies. 

One of these two resource centres is based at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) in Paris. Its role is to supply the participating laboratories with DNA from 40 three-generation families. The other resource centre is based at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in South Mimms, UK. This centre prepares and supplies the markers to be typed across the families. Two types of markers are supplied: DNA probes for Southern blotting and primers for analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 

In the initial 24 months of the project, over 1800 markers will be screened by the participating laboratories. Approximately half of the markers will be provided by the probe resource centre; the individual laboratories will supply the rest. 

In addition to the preparation and distribution of markers, the probe resource centre is also involved in isolating new markers, and in acquiring informative markers, which have been published in scientific literature, from the originators. In the isolation of new markers two approaches are being used. In the first approach, short repeat sequences have been identified from sequence databases and screened for polymorphic length variation by PCR. The second approach is to screen phage and cosmid libraries, either for polymorphic variation of short nucleotide repeats (as above) or with a synthetic decanucleotide probe which detects areas of high variability. The clones identified with this probe are highly likely to detect variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in Southern blot analysis. 

Both screening programmes have been set up and positive clones have been identified for further analysis. The work is expected to lead to the discovery of a number of new markers when the material has been fully analyzed.";;;;CSC;Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF);UK;"University of Cambridge;Universität Marburg;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK;University of Dublin;University College London;UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN;Medical Research Council (MRC);Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire;UNIVERSITY OF AARHUS;CEPH - Paris;Hospital Ramon y Cajal - Madrid;Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau - Barcelona;University of Leiden;CARDIFF UNIVERSITY;Universidade Nova de Lisboa;IMBB - Heraklion;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI CAGLIARI;Università degli Studi di Roma;RHEINISCHE FRIEDRICH-WILHELMS-UNIVERSITAET BONN;INSTITUT PASTEUR";"UK;DE;IE;NL;FR;DK;ES;PT;EL;IT";

This paper highlights the approach used for the development and evaluation of a low stress high pincount PQFP package for high reliability complementary metal oxide semiconductor application specific integrated circuit applications in the field of telecommunications, industrial control, automotive and computer electronics. Reliable die attach materials and moulding compounds for a low stress PQFP package are selected as a result of intensive material evaluation and process optimization, Mechanical stress simulations have been carried out to explain and confirm the mechanical stress measurements performed with the use of specially designed stress sensitive test devices. Reliability tests based on accelerated testing techniques have been performed using dedicated reliability test devices in order to assess the reliablity performance of the developed PQFP package. The developed package successfully passes highly accelerated stress and temperature cycling tests. The analysis with acoustic scanning microscopy shows that die package separation or delamination mainly occurs at the die corner on a limited number of devices.

The PLASIC project is concerned with the performance and reliability of plastic encapsulated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and its goal is to develop guidelines on how to build and evaluate reliable plastic packages for very large scale integration (VLSI) devices for high reliability applications.

Packaging materials and processes are being studied and optimized, and the stress quantified. The selection of a low stress die attach material and molding compound has been performed and work on the assembly process has been completed.

Device shifts are being investigated and interdependencies between reliability and front end processing analysed, as well as between reliability and design rules.

Modelling tools are being developed with the aim of evaluating the thermal and mechanical stress induced on the ASIC devices by both the plastic packaging technology and the surface mounting of the packages on the system boards of end users.

2-dimensional plain strain finite element models of PQFP have been developed. Extensive work was carried out on these models to study the influence of complete and partial delamination on the thermomechanical stress distribution within the package.

3-dimensional finite element techniques with temperature dependent material properties have been used to investigate the packaging stress on the surface of a die encapsulated in a plastic material.

An innovative accelerated humidity test method (HAST) has been evaluated and compared to the conventional one (THB). As a result of this study, a method for fast qualification procedures, based on HAST and temperature cycling, has been issued to replace the existing ones, saving qualification time.

This trend is driving the continuing development of micro- and nanofabrication techniques. However, understanding is lacking of electron-transport phenomena in these very small device structures. 
The aim of the NANOFET Action was to undertake a systematic investigation of the behaviour of nanometre-scale field-effect transistors. The GaAs-based HFET has been selected for investigation because parasitic phenomena affecting electron transport are minimised in this device. The results expected from this Action will be a major step towards understanding the relationships between the observed device characteristics and the underlying physical phenomena which determine electron transport.
The performance and physical limits of heterostructure field effect (HFET) transistors scaled down to ultrasubmicron dimensions were studied. The main focus is on horizontal electron transport in nanometre scale field effect transistors. The new technologies and methodologies needed to simulate, fabricate and characterize these very small devices were also developed. The results should allow guidelines to be drawn up for the next gneration of HFETs for information technology applications.

The main results of the research have been the following:
fabrication of high performance HFET transistors with gatelength below 0.1 micron and submicron source drain distance;
extensive simulation (1-dimensional and 2-dimensional) of nanometre scale HFETs, using Monte-Carlo and hydrodynamic models;
development of advanced microwave characterization models and techniques for HFETs, both at ambient and at cryogenic temperatures;
development of models and techniques for electrooptic sampling of electron transit times in HFET devices.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
-Epitaxial layers. Both AlGaAs/GaAs and strained AlGaAs/InGaAs layers were grown on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Various layer structures were compared and the vertical dimensions optimised with respect to the horizontal scale of the device. -Device processing. The smallest devices have a nanometre gate-length and a submicron source-drain gap. To fabricate the gate, e-beam-based nanolithography was being used. The fabrication of source, drain and channel regions involves both standard and ad vanced processing steps such as dry-etched gate recess and epitaxial ohmic contacts. 
-Device simulation. Monte Carlo techniques were used to investigate electron transport in very small two-dimensional structures. 
-Electrical characterisation. Complete HF characterisation was performed on-wafer, using the proper de-embedding techniques. Small-signal parametric models are under development. 
-Electro-optic sampling. In order to study transient transport in very small devices, electro-optic sampling techniques were developed with femtosecond laser excitations. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The main results of the Action have been the following: 
-fabrication of high performane HFET transistors with gatelength below 0.1 micron and submicron source-drain distance 
-extensive simulation (1D and 2D) of nanometer scale HFET's, using Monte-Carlo and hydrodynamic models

-development of models and techniques for electro-optic sampling of electron transit times in HFET devices 
POTENTIAL 
Although the major aim of the consortium is still to obtain fundamental physical information on very small HFET's, the industrial implications of this work have become increasingly clear during the second year. The combination of simulation, processing and characterisation techniques developed in this project has resulted in 'classical' devices with record performances. In order to further exploit these results, links have been established with the ESPRIT GIANTS consortium which is carrying out applications-oriented work on submicron HFETs.

5 deliverables were produced. The final deliverable covered the implementation of a demonstrator and the analysis of its results with a view to future trends in the areas of open architecture, user interface, network management and security.

The architecture contributes to the building up of a new generation of ERP systems, that respect the role, independence and responsibilities of each existing ERP actor.

. ERP system architecture  
. security and network management techniques  
. user interface and terminal issues  
. a specific environment with the possibility of one multi-usage card.  

A validation of the architecture chosen for the infrastructure was achieved by holding a seminar for potential users, and running a demonstration in Italy, to prove the success of technical choices.  These choices rely on existing standards and emerging technologies, IBC being not yet available.  

MERCHANT relies on an open architecture, whereby new applications are independent to each other and to the terminals.  Thus, service providers have a real possibility of innovation.  

Key Issues  
Based on its work, MERCHANT has made the following observation:  

Present evolution of the telecommunication services, and the actual splitting / distribution of bank processing that is being carried out, lead to an infrastructure based on many individual architectures.  The main elements that will contribute to a successful system at the disposal of several market sectors are:  

. distributed intelligence.  
. guaranteed services provided by a powerful and efficient networks,  
. multi-service terminals, reliable and easy to use.  

MERCHANT's architecture is aligned with each of these elements for success.  

Expected Achievements  
Five deliverables have been made.  The last one covers the implementation of a demonstrator and the analysis of its results with a view to future trends in the areas of open architecture, user interface, network management and security.  

Expected Impact  
The MERCHANT architecture should contribute to the building up of a new generation of ERP systems, that respects the role, independence and responsibilities of each existing ERP actor.";;;;;Sligos SA;FR;"Computer Industry Research Unit;BRITISH TELECOM PLC (BT);Alcatel/ISR;Sociedade Interbancaria de Servicos;SWIFT;Sixcom Olivetti Group";"UK;FR;PT;BE;IT";

The DESIRE process is a single-layer resist system based on surface imaging resulting from selective silylation and anisotropic dry development.
The work covered by the dry develop optical lithography (DRYDEL) project aimed to develop a deep ultraviolet (UV) sensitive photoresist and the associated processing, with the objective of extending the diffusion enhanced silylating resist (DESIRE) process down to the 0.3 micron range. The DESIRE process is a single layer resist system based on surface imaging resulting from selective silylation and and anisotropic dry development. The work was distributed over 4 work packages. In the first, the resist materials were developed. Variations of the various components of the resist (photoactive compound, resin composition and solvents) have been investigated. This has led to an optimization of the i-line version of the resist (for exposure at 365 nm) and to the fabrication of first samples of the deep UV version (for exposure at 248 nm).
In the second work package resist processing, such as silylation, dry development and pattern transfer, has been studied. Besides an optimization of each processing step, some more fundamental studies were carried out on silylation kinetics and swelling behaviour. Several new pieces of equipment were evaluated for silylation and dry development (including magnetically enhanced reactors and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). Using the optimized resist materials and processes, lithographic resolution down to 0.25 micron (lines/spaces) has been demonstrated with perfect line width control over highly reflective topography (on deep-UV stepper, lambda = 248 nm, numerical operture (NA) = 0.42). The process was demonstrated in the third work package. A final work package showed the feasibility of the DESIRE process for application in gallium arsenide processing. The lift off capabilities of the process were demonstrated by the fabrication of appropriate test circuits.";;;;;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum;BE;"GEC Plessey Semiconductors plc;Siemens AG;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);FARRAN TECHNOLOGY;UCB ELECTRONICS SA;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV";"UK;DE;FR;IE;BE;NL";

At present, the vast majority of voice and data services are catered for by separate networks employing either circuit- or packet-switched techniques. The main objective of DAMS was to address the problems associated with integrating these services within the business environment. DAMS provides both time-dependent voice and time-independent data services in a fully integrated and cost-effective system matching near-term customer requirements. It implemented and validated the system concepts outlined by DAMS-1 and will also identified the migratory paths necessary to support the new services which will become available in the longer term. DAMS-2 has been based on and complies with international standards.
In a distributed system, data segments can be managed in a fault tolerant way if they are replicated in several identical copies and distributed on data management servers running on different processors. If a server or a processor fails, copies of the data segments may be lost. To preserve fault tolerance during the lifetime of the system, for each data segment copy which is lost due to a server failure, a new copy has to be regenerated on one of the remaining servers. Therefore, all existing servers must be kept under surveillance to detect server or processor crashes as soon as possible. In this paper we describe 2 soultions for this surveillance problem. Both approaches are based on an election algorithm which has to cope with process and communication failures. The election algorithm is presented in detail. The protocols proposed in this paper have been developed as part of a distributed operating system which serves as a base for a distributed telecommunication control system.

The dynamically adaptable multiservice system (DAMS-2) project aimed to develop an advanced communication system capability addressing the needs of the private communications market. At present, the vast majority of voice and data services are catered for by separate networks employing either circuit switched or packet switched techniques. The main objective is to address the problems associated with integrating these services within the business environment. Both time dependent voice and time independent data services in a fully integrated and cost effective system matching near term customer requirements will be provided. Flexibility has been a major concern in the specification of the system. DAMS has been designed around a modular architecture incorporating a variable number of subsystems connected to a high speed backbone ring. This will allow DAMS to interface to other existing local area networks (LAN) so that customers will not waste their initial investment in these systems while still being able to take advantage of new service developments. Dynamic allocation allows efficient use of the bandwidth and hence efficient system performance.
Major aspects of the work will be directed towards the construction of a feasibility prototype for demonstration on a test site. This will provide sufficient infrastructure and software support to enable validated concepts to be ported to a development environment for the early exploitation of a product.
All hardware and software components have been developed and are being tested and integrated with a view to building the complete demonstrator.
The private communications market has traditionally been the driving force for the introduction of new services and facilities. DAMS was seen as the next evolutionary step necessary to meet the considerable demand identified for advanced multimedia services which cannot readily or easily be accommodated by current systems, but which will be required before the eventual introduction of the Integrated Broadband Communications Network (IBCN) in the second half of the 90s.

The major objective of project 5080 was the demonstration of the capability of a 0.7 micron logic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This was done according to plan. Demonstrators have been made in most cases incorporating a common 0.7 micron test module and qualification of 0.7 micron technology is in progress.

Both Philips and Siemens produced first silicon of their 3 layer metal demonstrator with excellent performances.

Test procedures for test chips and demonstrators are implemented and a scribe line test insert was designed and distributed as (GDSII) tape among the partners.

Commonality on characterisation procedures, reliability procedures and parameter definition was assessed and new common procedures on reliability measurements of dialectrics and metallisation patterns were created. A complete synthesis on device optimization was generated.

Several processing techniques and process problem areas were evaluated, compared and optimised or improved.

Major improvements were encountered in the multilevel metallisation processes and the isolation methodology.

Qualification of the 1.0 micron analogue process was realised. Several process improvements have been introduced and matching performance and linearity of analogue components were intensively characterised. A process flow for a 0.7 micron analogue process was defined.

The various process architectures for 0.5 micron digital CMOS were compared and a first draft set of design rules generated.

A common demonstrator of a multichip module in a low cost quad flat package was developed.

2 types of demonstrators were assembled: one with fully gold wire bonding, and the other with partially aluminium wire bonding (inner connections).
The Joint Logic Project is part of the seven-year JESSI technology programme ('Green Book'). The project is subdivided into a number of phases, as shown below. 

Period 6/90-12/91, Phase JLP-1, Objective 0.7 micron CMOS logic, Project no. 5080, 1.0 micron options 

Period 1992-94, Phase JLP-2, Objective 0.5 micron CMOS logic, Project no. 7363, 0.7 micron options 

Period 1995-96, Phase JLP-3, Objective 0.35 micron CMOS logic, 0.5 micron options 

The objective in the first phase was the demonstration, by each company, of the capability of a 0.7 micron basic logic process, and all subprojects contributed to solve technical problems associated with this objective. Each company provided a company-specific demonstrator in order to verify the competitiveness of the process for specific applications. 

A second objective was to produce and measure first silicon for various functional options, such as low-power non-volatile memories in 1.0 micron technology, and analogue logic in 1.0 and 0.7 micron technologies. 

In addition, these CMOS processes (basic and options) may serve as an input for high performance BICMOS processes, in which high-performance bipolar is combined with sub-micron CMOS.

The functional standardization necessary to ensure the interworking of an expandable, self-configuring home control system has been described. The system is modelled as a set of functional elements (simple devices, complex devices and device coordinators) overseen by a controller.

Home systems (HOME) applications are emerging as an important market sector. Communications and control standards for a systems approach have to be extended and further developed. The objectives of the HOME project are to:
propose standards suitable for bringing products onto the market which can be used in multibrand and multiapplications home systems, with extensions to cover small business and service premises;
analyze the wiring infrastructure, with special emphasis on bus integrated installation, requirements, and installation support;
validate and demonstrate the proposals made;
provide draft home and building specifications to relevant parties.

The current state of the art is characterized by the fact that though only single brand applications are visible in the market at present, preparations are underway internationally for a multiapplications systems approach. Preliminary proposals for standards to support such a development have been prepared in Japan and the United States, and also in Europe. However, it is obvious that further advances are necessary, and the HOME project intends to achieve them.

The main outcomes of the project are:

RICHE, which started as an ESPRIT project, has now evolved into an open initiative for pre-competitive collaboration with any user or industrial European organisation subscribing to its mission and objectives.
A unified Europe requires a common framework for the acquisition, processing, storage, retrieval and exchange of data for health care. This framework needs to be developed on the basis of a comprehensive set of internationally accepted standards and agreed rules for data protection. Such a framework would open up a large market for European technology by establishing requirements in terms of appropriateness, functionality and standard interfaces. The purpose of Reseau d'Information et de Communication Hospitalier Europeen (RICHE) is to evaluate, to anticipate and to integrate the different technological advances and results derived from ESPRIT (and other research and development programmes), and from the market, in order to exploit their potential within the health care domain.

The reseau d'information et de communication hospitalier Europeen (RICHE) project's mission was to construct a framework for open information and communication systems for health care in Europe, and to demonstrate the feasibility of this evolutionary approach.

The RICHE framework reference architecture provides the common basis for the construction of open hospital information systems. The open, modular approach adopted allows hospitals to build systems in accordance with their local requirements applying the same proven methodology and European standards. The emergence of such open systems in the hospital sector may lead to a revolution in the information technology (IT) health marketplace. The advantages are vendor independence, flexibility, availability and cost effectiveness.

The central part of RICHE is the innovative cooperative act management system. This allows physicians and nurses to automatically arrange for and report on all activities required within the hospital with respect to patient care. At the same time it offers the kind of data managers need to control the overall performance of hospital activities. This act management system is equipped with knowledge base and can provide (at this stage) both numerical information and text. Medical and nursing care information systems will complete the nucleus of the RICHE based sytem.

A further important outcome of RICHE is that what originally started as a project with a defined scope and duration has now evolved into a long term initiative with a wide range of possible follow up activities. A Stinchting Groupe RICHE has been set up in the Netherlands to further develp, enhance and maintain the RICHE framework architecture, publish its standards, give advice and assist in training.
The general objectives of RICHE are to develop and advance: 

- a modular European reference architecture and a global set of models for overall open information and communication systems for hospitals in their local environment, that show the relationships and interfaces between the various parts of the architecture 
- detailed architecture and models for selected hospital functions in line with the overall framework reference architecture 
- an intelligent co-operative act management system, supported by advance knowledge editing and management tools, capable of being used throughout the hospital information system 
- standards for federation and integration of existing and emerging functional system modules, and for the exchange of data between such modules and the kernel distributed hospital environment 
- an increasing set of references to practical implementation systems and projects, and development and industrialisation activities, capable of demonstrating the feasibility of the reference architecture and its models

The main features of this system will be demonstrated as a technological integration of diverse audio and visual media on a suitable workstation. 
The main aims of the research were:
to demonstrate a multimedia information system with intensive communication capabilities in a travel agency environment;
to access and exchange multimedia information through the integrated broadband communications (IBC) network;
to develop adequate hardware and software for presenting and processing multimedia information.

The research has resulted in the following achievements:
a demonstration system has been built, with multimedia and hypermedia handling capabilities and with an appropriate user interface, communication functions and service components;
objects for storing and presenting multimedia data have been specified and implemented;
a direct user interface supporting manipulation has been implemented;
an open and layered architecture has been designed and implemented for the communication part of multimedia communication, processing and representation (MCPR) terminal which allows adaption of the system to different network environments;
a system to digitise sound and to provide a video and audio switching facility has been developed.
Technical Approach  

Relevant technologies and methodologies for multimedia data communication and processing will be applied. Concerning broadband communication, the latest technologies such as high speed links and switching functions are considered. For the representation and processing of multimedia information a dedicated system capable to provide the functionality of hypermedia will be used.  An object oriented approach has been chosen to the questions of the development of the user interface and the representation of domain specific information.  

Key Issues  

- Demonstration of a multimedia information system with intensive communication capabilities in an environment of travel agency application domain.  
- Access and exchange of multimedia information through the IBC network.  
- Adequate hardware and software for presenting and processing multimedia information.  

Achievements:  

A demonstrator has been built, with multimedia and hypermedia handling and an appropriate user interface, communication functions and service components available. This supports further development and adaptation of IO- devices.  A travel agency scenario provides the script for the presentation of functionality supported.  

The objects for storing and presentation of multimedia data were specified and implemented.  The network structure for achieving the hypermedia functionality was specified and implemented as data structures overlaying multimedia data.  This structure can be used in advanced reader's and authoring tools for hypermedia document production.  A direct user interface supporting manipulation has also been implemented.  

An open and layered architecture has been designed and implemented for the communication part of MCPR terminal which allows the adaptation of our system to different network environments.  The application interface and network manager (AI&NM) controls the video and audio switch and the videodisk player, and has an interface with the signalling layers to carry out the call handling.  The signalling protocols implemented support the concept of service components, and provide more flexibility in allocation and reallocation of connections for the various information types used in multimedia services.  The MCPR system developed provides four external interfaces which are used for the transfer of video, audio, data, and signalling messages.  Contacts to CPN related projects (R1022 Technology for ATD and R1056 BIPED) have been set up to enable the feasibility model to be connected to various ATM broadband network demonstrators through terminal adaptors which will be specified and implemented in close conjunction w th these projects.  

A system to digitise sound and to provide video and audio switching facility has been developed: known as Avix (Audio, Video Interface and muX) .  This system is used for preparation of audio annotations to hypermedia documents.  A high speed data communication system (HS- CS) for Sun workstations with a VME bus has been developed: the effective data rate being 1920 Mbit/s. This is intended to be used via a transparent channel within a broadband transmission system of eg 140 Mbit/s, such as the German Vorlaeufer Breitband Netz (VBN) which is available at both the sites of SEL and Telenorma.  To access the VBN, available signalling hardware has been adapted to the MCPR-system.  All necessary primitives for network signalling are transferred over a serial interface.  A video disc containing information relevant for the application domain (tourist information about countries of involved project partners) was edited and manufactured as a base for video clips integrated in hypermedia documents.  Company related  nformation is also available.  

The work has resulted so far in twelve published papers.  

Expected Impact  

This project should demonstrate to future users an easy way to access information with IBC facilities. One consequence is that multimedia environment will influence future office and home application domains such as education, advertising, consulting and many others.  

Exchange and coordination of geographically distributed work will be supported with usable systems for multimedia communication, representation and processing.  Value added services will enhance the capabilities for human knowledge acquisition and processing.  

Service components for videotelephony, video-conference and  multi-media document transfer are considered to be implemented in the multimedia terminal for use in existing national broadband networks (eg VBN - EBIT) and also together with the demonstrators being produced by other RACE projects, eg R1011 - BCPN.";;;;;Standard Elektrik Lorenz AG (SEL);DE;"Alcatel Standard Electrica SA;Alcatel Air Navigation Face SpA;Centro Studi e Applicazioni in Tecnologie Avanzate Tecnopolis (CSATA);Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo;Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH";"ES;IT;DE";

Technical Approach  

ADVANCE uses a mixture of techniques combining literature studies, problem analysis, and experimentation with prototype specifications and prototype sub-systems.  In particular, the project covers various phases in the life-cycle of prototyping information systems, from requirements definition through to demonstration systems. There are four parallel work streams:  
- development of a conceptual framework  
- assessment of AIP techniques and technical standards applicable  
- development of prototypes  
- development of a set of criteria for the evaluation of design options.  
The final phase of the project will be to produce a consolidated report stating the achievements of prototyping, requirements definition, and assessments of AIP.

The workbench will consist of prototype simulation models, demonstrators, and design tools.
A designer's workbench for one of a kind production systems was developed, based on integrating several key paradigms in computer integrated manufacture (CIM) systems design, such as workflow structuring and group technology, decision making, organization of resources, and communication.

Firstly, the research has studied existing theories on the various aspects of one of a kind production system design. 7 paradigms are investigated: human, organizational, data oriented, functional, decisional, communication and economic.
Secondly, descriptions of the paradigms have been produced using a questionnaire with which a local research team can describe a particular factory from all the viewpoints concerned. These paradigms are synthesized into a global conceptual model for one of a kind production system design.

The integration of the 7 different viewpoints has been addressed and true integration is found in those cases where a single design choice has to be evaluated starting from a number of different points of view. A set of central design issues has been identified, and they have been related to the main performance criteria. A hardware base (mainly Macintosh), and software environments (Hypercard, Stella and Simmek) have been chosen, and the formalization of the conceptual model is ready. This work has resulted in a set of related models, which are structured in an open architecture. A prototype modelling workbench is available.

The project investigates the integration of the various scientific disciplines involved in the design of production systems. It is limited to one of a kind production, and is especially relevant to computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). The central idea is that the alternatives available in redesigning a factory cross the boundaries of established scientific or engineering disciplines. Similarly, the performance indicators which measure the suitability of a redesign cross the boundaries of established disciplines. Consequently, the project focuses on these performance indicators as well. The relationship between design choices and performance indicators is modelled in a qualitative manner by a so called connectance model. This model is implemented in a tool called REMBRANDT, which allows the user to browse through available design theory. Detailed knowledge of relations between design choices and performance indicators is being developed in a number of so-called drawing models. These drawing models are quantitative in nature, and can be fed with data from actual companies.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Firstly, the Action has studied existing theories on the various aspects of one-of-a-kind production system design. Seven paradigms are investigated: human, organisational, data-oriented, functional, decisional, communication and economic. 
Secondly, descriptions of the paradigms have been produced using a questionnaire with which a local research team can describe a particular factory from all the viewpoints concerned. These paradigms are synthesised into a global conceptual model for one-of-a-kind production system design. This conceptual model relates design choices made when designing a CIM production system to performance indicators deriving from all the paradigms. The conceptual model has been implemented in a prototype modelling workbench on a Macintosh. The workbench has an open architecture, such that new, specific models can easily be added.. 
The initial implementation of the conceptual model has provided guidelines and examples of how to use the workbench utilities. The implementation and guidelines are used for modelling existing industrial test-sites. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The questionnaires are available. The integration of the seven different viewpoints has been addressed. The main difference between viewpoints are the criteria which are used when evaluating the choices made during the design of a production system. True integration is found in those cases where a single design choice has to be evaluated starting from a number of different points of view. A set of central design issues has been identified, and they have been related to the main performance criteria. A hardware base (mainly Macintosh), and software environments (Hypercard, Stella and Simmek) have been chosen, and the formalisation of the conceptual model is ready. This work has resulted in a set of related models, which are structured in an open architecture. A prototype modelling workbench is available. 
The central idea in the Action is that the alternatives available in redesigning a factory cross the boundaries of established scientific or engineering disciplines. Therefore, these alternatives or 'design choices' play a major role in our approach. Similarily, the performance indicators, which measure the suitability of a redesign, cross the boundaries of established disciplines. Consequently, the FOF action also focuses on these performance indicators. 
The relationship between design choices and performance indicators is modelled in a qualitative manner by a so-called connectance model. This model is implemented in a tool called REMBRANDT, which allows us to browse through available design theory. Detailed knowledge of relations between design choices and performance indicators is being developed in a number of so-called drawing models. These drawing models are quantitative in nature, and can be fed with data from actual companies. 
Currently, the first prototype of the designer's workbench is available for demonstration. 
POTENTIAL 
The main result of the Action is a more powerful and complete theory of production management that relates design choices to performance indicators from various points of view. This is a necessary precondition for the use of CIM in one-of-a-kind production systems. 
The workbench is now used for the development of training courses in companies and for post-experience education. 
The Action will lead to an integrated approach for the design of future OKP systems, in which design choices are evaluated concurrently from various points of view. A prototype workbench with an open architecture has now been developed, in which models that relate specific design choices to specific performance indicators can be interconnected and jointly evaluated. 
Currently nine models are included in the workbench, which concentrate on production management issues. The aim is to extend the area of knowledge by adding more models, specifically about shopfloor and engineering issues. Given the open architecture, other researchers will also be able to add models.";;;;;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN;NL;"UNIVERSITY COLLEGE GALWAY;SINTEF PRODUCTION ENGINEERING;DANMARKS TEKNISKE HOJSKOLE;HELSINKI UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;Université de Bordeaux I;Universität Bremen";"IE;NO;DK;FI;FR;DE";

Standard equipment will be used for the mechanical and sensor systems, and a major part of the effort will be focused on software development to ensure that the robot will be extremely versatile and adaptable to new tasks with minimal reprogramming.

The concept involves measuring and identifying the component to be welded, welding it in position and finally inspecting the finished welds. The robot relies for its path instructions on a number of sensors, several of which will be used in concert to identify the start of the weld path, the weld seam trajectory, corner intersections and the weld finish-point. In addition, the welding process parameters are determined from databases, algorithms and knowledge-based systems, and as the welding proceeds the results will be assessed in real time and corrected according to other algorithmic rules or intelligent assessments. This system will remove many of the limitations of current adaptive controlled arc-welding robots.

- early process design and instrumentation with overall system performance objectives 
- simple control schemes for multivariable processes 
- hierarchical control and steady-state process optimisation of large-scale industrial processes.
The aim of the project is to develop an integrated computer aided process design environment (the EPIC workbench), enhancing the cooperation between process engineering and control engineering activities at the early stages of the design of production processes. Advanced software engineering methods have been developed within the environment of practising process engineers, and progress has been made in the theoretical fields of control engineering, optimization and integrated plant design. The latest version of the EPIC workbench allows the coordinated use of a number of analysis and design tools supporting a complete preliminary process design cycle. In the present phase the project is focused on the execution of the industrial case studies. The objective of these case studies is the validation of the developed tools and algorithms, and the improvement of the performance of the FCCU through the optimization of the steady state operation and the construction of advanced control configurations. It is believed that a profit of 1 to 2% will be gained.
The principal tasks will be to: 

- specify and develop methods and tools for early process design, for both well- and ill-defined process models, to enable the formulation of the appropriate conceptual, qualitative and quantitative framework within which the designer can evaluate early design options 
- specify methods and tools addressing the optimisation and regulation of complex industrial processes

MAXI focuses on prototype development, integration and proof-of-concept laboratory demonstrations. The system is able to support multi-megabit applications, such as LAN-to-LAN linking, mainframe-mainframe data transfer, high-resolution image exchange, and 2 Mbit/s isochronous services (such as video conferencing, PABX interconnections, etc.).
A multiservices communication system suitable to meet the demand for flexible communication services coming from business users located within metropolitan areas has been developed. Prototype development, integration and proof of concept laboratory demonstrations have been carried out. The system is able to support multimegabit applications, such as local area network (LAN) to LAN linking, mainframe-mainframe data transfer, high resolution image exchange, and 2 Mbit/s isochronous services. 

The system uses the system architecture, specification, breadboards, hardware and software modules that were developed in the MAX project, and is based on commercially available components and technologies including single mode optical fibres, optical high speed electronics, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), advanced multiprocessor architectures and software packages. It permits: 
the achievement of proof of the system's principles by a laboratory prototype demonstration; 
establishment of the range of major applications to be supported by a multiservice metropolitan area network (MAN) with a transmission speed of about 155 Mbit/s, and testing of the performance of a typical gathering network suitable for operating over distances of up to a few tens of kilometres; 
promotion of convergence towards common European MAN standards and implementation of such standards (providing therefore valuable information to standard revision); 
exploitation of worldwide market opportunities for MAX-based products and services by those consortium partners wishing to enter such a market. 

The system uses optical transmission systems compliant with synchronous digital hierarchy, SDH (CCITT Recommendations G.707-G.709) at 155 Mbit/s, distributed multiple access protocol based on DQDB (ETSI/IEEE standard MAC protocol), network management system based on telecommunication management network, TMN (CCITT Recommendation M.3010). The compatibility with the asynchronous transfer mode, ATM (CCITT B-ISDN Recommendation I.121) and with the existing broadband service specifications (such as the connectionless broadband data service, CBDS, defined by ETSI) is taken into account in MAXI. 

The project has been successfully promoting the MAX/MAXI concepts to foster convergence towards a common European position with MAN standard setting bodies (eg in ETSI). Active participation, including delivery of contributions, has been taking place also in the relevant committees of the CCITT and IEEE.

17053;A1005 (8425);GAMES;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;A General Architecture for Medical Expert Systems;;;;"A suitable general architecture for medical expert systems has been defined in terms of generic tasks (diagnosis, therapy planning and monitoring) to be executed for developing medical reasoning in a patient's management. Their epistemological structure has been investigated. The focus of the project was on the comparison and validation of different approaches in order to implement the generate and test cycle, which represents the basic feature of the epistemological model of medical reasoning developed. The project created a new abstraction paradigm aiming at unifying various ideas for the analysis and design of a knowledge based system (KBS). These ideas all attempt to provide descriptions of KBS reasoning for solving a particular kind of problems at a conceptual level that is above the implementation. The proposal was based on a 2-levels analysis of KBS: an epistemological and a computational level. Ontology and inference model of a KBS have to be defined. Ontology represents the conceptual model of entities and relationships composing the domain knowledge, while the inference model is the conceptual representation of the inference structure to execute a task by managing that ontology. The project identified 3 generic tasks executed by medical KBS: diagnosis, therapy planning and monitoring. They are interrelated but can be submitted to separate epistemological analyses. The main result of these analyses was that these generic tasks manage different ontologies, but can be executed using a unique inference model. Such a model involves 3 different inference types: abduction, deduction, and induction. Thus, medical reasoning may be broken down into 3 different phases: initial information is used to generate (abduce) plausible hypotheses (hypothesis generation phase), then these hypotheses are used as starting conditions to forecast (deduce) expected consequences, then these expected consequences are matched with the state of affairs in the patient in order to confirm or falsify (induce) these hypotheses (hypothesis testing phase).
We propose a coherent project that will address the definition of a General Architecture for Medical Expert Systems, called GAMES. New representations of complex medical knowledge and reasoning processes will be explored. Experimentation at two levels will play a major role : On the one hand, we will develop small expert systems prototypes ; on the other hand, paper and pencil scenarios will serve as a basis for envisaging the main features of new generation medical expert systems. 
We believe that medical practice requires the use of categorical and probabilistic reasoning and mathematical modelling, and that many tasks should be addressed by combinations of these approaches. The GAMES project will help the necessary process of cross-fertilizing artificial intelligence and decision theory : It will use categorical reasoning to develop and explain diagnostic conclusions, probabilistic and utility-based reasoning to address the problem of therapy planning, and categorical reasoning and mathematical modelling and case base reasoning to monitor treatment and recommend changes to treatment, if needed. 
The clinical value of system modules and methodology tools will be assessed and evaluated with medical experts in the domains of anemia and breast cancer. The objectives of evaluation are twofold : 
a) to assess the relevance and reliability of GAMES in the aforementioned clinical domains and 
b) to assess the degree to which the structure proposed by GAMES can provide a system platform for developing and implementing KBS's in other clinical domains and which could be integrated with other HIS (Hospital Information Systems) components, too, for improving the process of health-care delivery. 
Cross-fertilization opportunities between AIM and other European initiatives will be highlighted as well as requirements for an innovative medical expert systems architecture.

The components of such a system are, by and large, already available in the form of database systems, interface systems, electronic message systems, simulation models, and communications technology. A suitable system architecture for the integration of a selection of these technologies is, however, not available and neither are software tools for application generation and for the support of a system throughout its life cycle.

The aim of the Project was to develop an integrated information system capable of supporting the complex, dynamic, distributed decision making associated with the management of emergencies. The focus was the definition of a system architecture and the development of an application generator and tools to support the complete system life cycle.

The support of emergency management was chosen as a specific application area in order to target the project properly. The area selected involved the on site and off site management of emergencies that may arise in 2 particular industries, nuclear power generation and chemical products (which may be hazardous when accidentally released). The integrated information system is designed so that, when implemented, it can serve as a dedicated support for decision makers who manage rare but potentially severe events in these 2 industries.

Concrete project outcomes included the design, implementation, testing and evaluation of 2 demonstration system and the demonstration of the operation and maintenance of the decision support system. As the systems which constitute the areas of focus for the project are expected to have long life cycles, system support and maintenance will be important. They will thus provide a rich testing ground for system management tools.
A further outcome from the project was the development of guidelines and strategies for the proper results (architectures and software tools embedded in the application generator) in a variety of industrial sectors.";;;;;RISOE NATIONAL LABORATORY;DK;"Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit mbH;JUTLAND TELEPHONE (JTAS);INSPECCION Y GARANTIA DE CALIDAD;ORGA F A MEYER;Uitesa;SCAITECH A/S;Technical Research Center of Finland;TECNATOM SA;CREON APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT;DANSK INTERNATIONALT MILJOCENTER;TECNICAS REUNIDAS SA;STUDSVIK NUCLEAR;Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energia e l'Ambiente (ENEA)";"DE;DK;ES;FI;BE;SE;IT";

Compacted expansive clays are proposed as engineered barriers in reference concepts for the disposal of heat-emitting nuclear waste in granite and clay.The backfill material of the BACCHUS 2 test consists of a mixture of high density pellets and powder. This granular backfill material was characterized. The hydraulic conductivity and swelling pressure was measured as a function of the dry density. X-ray tomography has been applied successfully to measure the evolution of the density distribution during hydartion.

The installation procedure, materials and techniques used in the BACCHUS 2 were close to realistic industrial processes and capabilities. To gain more confidence in the hydromechanical model for unsaturated clay-based materials, BACCHUS 2 was instrumented so that it can be used as a validation experiment.

The instrumentation (including total stress, pore-water pressure and water content measurements) of the backfill material and of the surrounding clay massif has allowed observation of the hydration process. The measured parameters in the backfill show clearly the hydration effect (ie a strong increase in water content, pore-water pressure and a redistribution of the mechanical stresses). Results of the natural hydration modelling are in good agreement with the in situ measurements.
Work programme:

1. Study and optimization of the backfill material
The sealing material will consist in a mixture of clay pellets and clay powder. The ratio powder/pellets and the density, size and water content of the pellets will be used as parameters in the optimization process.
Fundamental properties of this mixture such as the hydraulic conductivity and the swelling pressure will be measured.

2. Recuperation of the BACCHUS 1 experiment
The BACCHUS 1 mock-up installed in '88 will be retrieved by over coring. The aspects and hydro-mechanical properties of the retrieved Boom clay seal and the FoCa-bentonite buffer will be studied.

3. In-situ demonstration of the application of the backfill material 
The demonstration will consist in the sealing of the large borehole (50 cm diameter) left after the retrieval of the BACCHUS 1 mock-up. The backfill material developed under 1 will be installed around a central filter tube which will also be used as support and access tube for the instrumentation.

Current design systems support mainly structural synthesis from the architectural down to the layout level. To fully exploit the integration complexity of future fabrication technologies, it is crucially necessary to provide a specification at the highest system level and to exploit (interactive) high-level synthesis techniques to arrive at an efficient ASIC architecture. The Action's objective is 'true' silicon compilation, which allows several mapping strategies and architectural approaches and can handle a broad class of applications. The ultimate goal is to pave a complete path from specification to architecture. e.
System-level specification techniques and high-level synthesis techniques for the efficient design of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) architectures were developed. Currently, complex systems are mapped with the help of computer-aided design (CAD) tools onto silicon, starting from a register-transfer (RT) level architectural description. However, the bottleneck in mega-chip designs does not lie in realising the layout from this RT level description, but in mapping the intended behaviour onto a suitable architecture. Work has focused on investigating novel design methodologies. These are tested (partly manually, partly with prototype design tools) on realistic examples derived from real-life applications. The main results include the following. Firstly, a new abstract system model based on Petri nets, defined and evaluated on several algorithms, and a successful implementation of formal verification with propositional temporal logic. Secondly, new contributions to methodologies for mapping algorithms described at a high level onto regular array architectures, (in particular direct mapping of nested loops and re-indexing of descriptions) and onto multiplexed datapath architectures with complex controllers (in particular in the areas of datapath definition, scheduling and assignment). Thirdly, the development of general global optimization techniques based on neural nets and genetic algorithms, and finally, for controller synthesis, optimizations at both the architecture and timing levels.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Research at different levels on the design trajectory from system description to architecture is being pursued, namely: 
-system definition in terms of formal specification of abstract behaviour and formal verification of correctness 
-system partitioning 
-mapping of subsystems onto architectures with the development of synthesis strategies for regular arrays and lowly multiplexed data-paths (where the main emphasis of the project lies) 
-investigation of new optimisation paradigms for use in synthesis systems (examples are genetic algorithms and neural nets) 
-architectural synthesis for the control part with design optimisation and technology mapping techniques. 
The shortcomings of each level are being identified and ways of tackling them defined. Efficiency of the resulting architectures (in terms of throughput, chip-area and memory) is an important objective. The resulting IC designs will comply with the band-width, power and pin-count limitations of VLSI components.

POTENTIAL 
The results stemming from the ASCIS Action are of crucial importance for future designs in many application domains, such as image-processing, telecommunication and factory automation. For complex systems such as these, at least 70% of the design effort is currently spent on arriving at the architectural specification. The ASCIS action helps to bypass this severe bottleneck by automating the synthesis process leading from behaviour to architecture. A transfer of these new technologies to development-oriented projects (with the participation of large systems companies) will help shape the future ASIC and systems industry in Europe in the second half of the decade.";;;;;INTERUNIVERSITAIR MIKROELEKTRONICA CENTRUM;BE;"Technische Hochschule Darmstadt;DANMARKS TEKNISKE HOJSKOLE;UNIVERSITY OF PATRAS;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN;Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble";"DE;DK;EL;NL;FR";

5 issues of a newsletter, available in English, French or German;
2 issues of the Multimedia Journal, including a video magazine;
13 issues of the Delta Bulletin, published in an electronic format on the teleconferencing service provided by EUROKOM.
 As DELTA will pilot the way to a European Learning Technology Community, it needs two strong stands of communication: 
- amongst DELTA participants, to ensure maximum synergy between the consortia by an up to date exchange of ideas and solutions, 
- from DELTA participants to interested parties in European Educational environment to ensure a rapid and widespread application of the newly developed tools and systems. 

In both cases it would be problematic, if communication only remained a one way distribution of opinions and results. Real interactive communication is urgently needed, to establish continuous development as well as adaptive cooperation between theoreticians and practitioners. Such a solution needs publishing expertise to serve as an agent between the interests of information providers on the one hand and users, administrators and applicants on the other. While paper and surface mail still remains a powerful tool for communication, especially in an IT&T environment electronic media could and should be used by exploiting their specific advantages. Developing a structured body ELTA could offer a powerful platform for all kinds of actors on a europewide scale. This process of formation has to be accompanied by the professional creation of publishing services, which ELTA - amongst others 
- can use as tools. A pan European learning technology environment is a goal, remarkable steps forward can be obtained. Nevertheless national and language bound structures still dominate in that field. Developing a European consciousness requires contacts within their well known national environment. 

INTERMAPS proposes a coordinated mix of services: 

1.INTERACTIVE NEWSLETTER 
- with continually updated electronic DELTA news and computer conferencing/interactive bulletin board facilities on EUROKOM, 
- and a bimonthly print format in at least three language versions (English, French, German) with different national editions. 

2.MULTIMEDIA SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL 
- publishing intermediate results with minimum time delay, 
- with a volume published every four months containing print, floppy discs, video cassettes where appropriate, 
- in English, with detailed summaries in the main languages of the community. 

3.VIDEO MAGAZINE 
- It is necessary and integral part of the overall interactive package to present visual aspects of case studies, complex application environments, opinions, discussions 
- by an hourly broadcast every four months via OLYMPUS backed by distribution of video cassettes on request. 

To achieve this results, we need a well defined close European cooperation of partners, sharing their expertise in different fields and their familiarities with different national backgrounds and attitudes.";;;;;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg;DE;"COVENTRY UNIVERSITY;SYSTEM DYNAMICS LTD;KOMMUNICATIONSVERBUND;EXPORT-AKADEMIE BADEN-WURTTENBERG;CENTRE NATIONAL UNIV.

Special emphasis will be put on the use for shiphandling purposes of information made available in real time. The proposed service will take benefit of available information currently collected and/or processed by entities such as existing and planned VTS, search and rescue organisations, pilotage, shipping agents, meteorological services, ships' routeing agencies, etc...  

The main objective of the project is to reduce maritime traffic costs.  

Costs will be considered in a broad sense.  

They will encompass:  
- all costs resulting from the normal operation of means used for the performance of activities generating maritime traffic. Thus they will include in addition to the ship amortization and running costs, the costs of services provided at sea, in ports and fairways.  
The cost of waiting times due to services unavailabilities is also included:  
- costs of organisations or services responsible for preventing or maintaining at an acceptable level dysfunctionments of the traffic production systems;  
- losses and damages caused by anomalies and accidents of any kind;  
- costs of remedying or alleviating their consequences amongst which the impact of pollutions of may be catastrophic.  

The project will address the Mediterranean area. It will therefore offer a regional coverage.  

The project will be a pilot project. It intends to provide a basis for an experimental implementation. It is hoped that most of its features will be transposable to other maritime zones in Europe.  

To this end, close co-operation will be established with the other EURET 1.3 project which the EC has taken into consideration.
The phase of the RTIS study was mainly devoted to the organization of the work and to design and implementation of adequate scientific methods and managerial tools.

An experimental implementation will apply methods of performance and power modelling for VHSICs to optimising complex digital system designs. The new approach should work for conservative technologies as well.
A new method to cope with the design of very complex and high speed circuits and systems is being developed. This method will enable system designers who are not specialists at near-silicon levels to implement high-performance circuits. The method will be implemented in an experimental system and applied to selected circuit design examples. The action has concentrated on the following aspects:

power estimation of regular structures;
statistical power estimation (synchronised event power model);
timing modelling by abstraction;
characterization of interconnect;
characterization of cells;
circuit extraction of parameters in multiconductor transmission lines.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The first tasks are to define: 
-methods for modelling interconnects and devices in the power and timing domain 
-a notation for the adaptation of the methods adopted to different technologies 
-a method to extract all data needed from the layout. 
Methods will then be developed for implementation in an experimental system that will be validated and evaluated with respect to selected GaAs and CMOS circuit design examples. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The action has concentrated on the following aspects: 
-power estimation of regular structures 
-statistical power estimation (synchronised event power model) 
-timing modelling by abstraction 
-characterisation of interconnect 
-characterisation of cells 
-circuit extraction supporting interconnect modelling 
-accurate extraction of parameters in multiconductor transmission lines 
POTENTIAL 
The results of the Action will form the basis of a design for performance methods for complex VHSICs adaptable to a wide variety of technologies. The effect of the method being developed will be a substantial reduction in the frequency of reimplementationof an important class of CAE tools.";;;;;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET KAISERSLAUTERN;DE;"TELECOM PARIS;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CANARIAS";"FR;ES";

In the health care system there is a need for a common language to relate clinical evaluation and resource use. This proposal is directed at the development of systems to support both clinical and hospital management.
!!A project has been set up to develop framework systems supporting both clinical and hospital management and laying the foundation for a common language relating resource use and clinical evaluation. The main conclusion of the project was that patient classification systems (PCS) can be defined for a specific objective, like resource management, quality assurance or planning. A European approach is proposed to managing clinical care both from the demand and from the supply side. In the area of medical data the concept of a minimum basic data set was revised and a European patient classification systems framework defined. In the area of hospital cost accounting a minimum standardized cost data set and common and flexible cost systems were defined to be applicable in different countries and in different hospitals. Management applications have been proposed for financial, utilization review, quality assurance, resource allocation, planning and budgeting. A conceptual framework was developed for a management support system uniting all the different applications. Several propositions outline the conceptual background of the project: 
clinicians and managers need a common language for linking clinical evaluation and resource consumption; 
the basis of such a common language are individual cases classified into groups; 
the development of information systems will improve the quality of information available to managers and support various management activities; 
the adherence of clinicians and hospital managers to the case based methodology will lead to more coherent articulation of the aims of any institution.
It is based on the following approach : 
I. Specification of requirements for the collection, coding and classification of hospital activity data (inpatient and ambulatory) and hospital cost data. 
II. The development of prototype modules for (i) the measurement of hospital case-mix (or product) and (ii) the estimation of hospital costs on a case-mix basis. 
III. Development of specifications for applications of the prototype modules for hospital budgeting, resource allocation, quality assessment, utilization review. 
IV. The integration of the case-mix based activity and cost modules into a case-based hospital management model. Execution of a pilot test of the management model in at least five member states, to evaluate the prototype and to propose further developments.

- To conduct multicentre trials on the treatment of HIV infection, through an independent network, focusing on trials:
which are not funded by the industry:
aiming to define standard therapeutic approaches for relatively rare disorders such as Kaposi's sarcoma;
aiming to improve the prevention of major infections complicating HIV infection.
The aim of the network is to avoid duplication of trials implemented in the United States or elsewhere in Europe. By identifying those aspects of clinical research which are not covered by national efforts and not funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the ENTA represents the specificity of European clinical research for which EEC funding is the main financial support.
- To collaborate with other concerted actions such as 'AIDS in Europe' for natural history studies.
- To promote a regular exchange of personnel for training throughout the network in order to improve collaboration between teams, which will have a direct positive impact on clinical trials and the care of patients.
At a time when acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical research in Europe was done either on an individual basis or at national level the need for European collaborative studies was recognized and the European Network for Treatment of AIDS (ENTA) was established. Experience has shown that the joint collaborative efforts of ENTA were welcomed.

The aim of ENTA is to conduct multicentre prospective trials on the treatment of HIV infection and the related opportunistic infections and cancers.
5 prospective European multicentre trials on toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis and Kaposi have been implemented, and 51 centres from 11 countries have been involved.

It has been shown that Pyrimethamine plus Clindamycin is a valuable alternative to Pyrimethamine plus Sulfadiazine for the acute treatment of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The study also demonstrated that Pyrimethamine plus Clindamycin at reduced dosages is less effective than Pyrimethamine plus Sulfadiazine in the long term prevention of cerebral toxoplasmosis relapse.

In the study comparing a 3 drug and 4 drug treatment of HIV associated tuberculosis, it was shown that both regimens are equivalent in terms of efficacy and tolerance.

A study has been started comparing the efficacy and tolerability, in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma, of Interferon plus Zidovudine versus chemotherapy plus Zidovudine. It is planned to recruit 200 patients over a 2 year period.
The European AIDS situation is characterized by an important epidemiological diversity. It has been shown that clinical manifestations of AIDS differ significantly between northern, central and southern Europe. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, CMV chorioretinitis and Kaposi's sarcoma are significantly more frequent in northern Europe, whereas tuberculosis and cerebral toxoplasmosis are much more prevalent in the southern parts. It has also been shown that the prevalence of PCP has decreased in recent years whereas an opposite trend has been observed for toxoplasmosis. Mortality patterns are also heterogeneous and longer survival has been generally observed in northern and central Europe as compared to the southern countries. The European epidemics also differ significantly from other developed countries such as the United States or Australia in terms of the incidence of opportunistic infections: toxoplasmosis and tuberculosis are much more frequent in Europe whereas cryptococcosis is more prevalent in the United States. Finally, an increased incidence of bacterial infections has been recently observed, which opens new fields of investigation in the area of antimicrobial agents and antibacterial vaccines.
These considerations emphasize the fact that there is a continuous need for clinical trials taking into account:
- The specificity of the European epidemic.
- The variability of clinical manifestations throughout Europe.
- The modifications in the incidence and prevalence of clinical manifestations that occur with time.
- The variability of mortality rate throughout Europe.
- The fact that comparative trials or trials involving rare disorders can be completed more quickly if recruitment is achieved on a multinational level.";;;;CON;Saint-Pierre University Hospital;BE;;;

Drag reduction provides clear economic benefits in terms of fuel savings, extended operational range and/or increased payload. In addition, reductions in fuel consumption will have a direct beneficial effect upon environmental pollution levels. The laminar flow concepts offers the largest performance gain of any single technology. Thus the main objectives of this project are to prove the basic concepts of this technology and to prepare the tools, methods and systems required for its successful application to a wide range of practical airframes, from small subsonic commuters to large transonic transport aircraft.
The first phase of the project was successful. All objectives have been reached. The numerical tools developed and experimental data collected in the project will be applied and analyzed in more detail in the ELFIN II project.
Wind tunnel test of the Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) concept on a large-scale wing model with perforated leading edge. Two suction philosophies will be investigated; discrete lower surface suction for flow stabilization downstream of minor surface discontinuities, and extensive distributed leading-edge suction for stabilization of high sweep, high Reynolds number flows. 
Testing techniques and suction device development for wind tunnel and flight testing. The full exploitation and adaptation of the laminar flow concept relies upon improvements in and modification to existing measurement techniques for use in industrial wind tunnels and under flight conditions. The suction methodology and associated systems as required in the wind tunnel test and also for practical aircraft application will be developed and supplied. 
Boundary layer and transition prediction methods for laminar wing design application. Accurate laminar boundary layer calculations are vital for reliable transition prediction. Existing stability codes utilize an empirical correlation for transition prediction. These codes will be extended to include important terms previously neglected. Database methods will be developed as practical and efficient design tools and direct simulation studies will be initiated as a long term solution to transition prediction.

The work would support the identified and growing need for European SMEs to make effective use of information systems in their efforts to maintain competitiveness and sustain growth. 
Multiple aspects of the feasibility and implementation approaches for an integrated computer based system for supporting information technology (IT) planning in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe have been investigated. The work supports the identified and growing need for European SMEs to make effective use of information systems in their efforts to maintain competitiveness and sustain growth. 

The potential benefits of IT within large organizations are well appreciated, but the appropriate approach for smaller and less sophisticated organizations are less clear. The opportunity for such organizations to make use of IT depends on the quality of the advice they receive and the appropriateness of the delivery channels. 

The action was organized around 3 major activities: 
a review of the current state of the art, including consideration of practice, literature and software in this area as well as an examination of IT strategies within the SME sector; 
preliminary development studies that covered the establishment of user profiles, identification of target sectors, selection of knowledge acquisition strategy and specification of the knowledge transfer policy; 
implementation experiments that consisted of preparatory knowledge acquisition, a knowledge representation study, analysis of user interface issues and initial preprototype experiments. 

The results included a review of IT planning in the context of SMEs and the establishment of user needs; an investigation into the nature of the knowledge in the domain; and preliminary software. These results are intended to be of value both in direct product development terms and in developing the debate on the appropriate way to introduce IT into SMEs.

18111;2001;SPRITE;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Storage, Processing and Retrieval of Information in a Technical Environment;16/01/1989;15/01/1992;;"At present, major problems exist with producing, maintaining, and updating technical documentation, and as a result, delays in releasing new products and inconsistencies in product documentation often occur. These problems frequently stem from the lack of availability of adequate support tools, or the lack of integration among the tools that do exist. The SPRITE project aims to solve these problems by developing an integrated system for the production and maintenance of technical documentation.
The SPRITE project aims at the development of an integrated system for the production and maintenance of technical documentation. SPRITE provides for authors and managers an information management system supporting direct access to the complete information environment, ranging from documents stored in the internal database over paper based files (drawings, reports) to electronic computer aided design files and external databases. This result highlights important aspects of a system for technical documentation: document architecture, organisation of the document space, versioning, multiauthoring, and integration of data stored on external media. For each of these aspects, the solutions developed in the SPRITE project are presented.

Major problems exist with producing, maintaining, and updating technical documentation which frequently stem from the lack of availability of adequate support tools, or the lack of integration among the tools. The project aimed to solve these problems by developing an integrated system for the production and maintenance of technical documentation. The system consists of 6 components: a multimedia database (text and graphics), a document processor, a scanning and recognition component, an information acquisition component, a printing component and a retrieval component.

The central component of the system is a multimedia database (MMD), in which documents and information extracted from external sources as well as newly generated documents will be stored. Searching in the MMD will be possible using a browser. For document generation the system has a multimedia WYSIWYG document processor, supporting both text and graphics editing. One of the important features of the document processor is its multiauthor capability. This feature is realized by assigning the document's parts to different authors and by supplying the MMD with a selective locking mechanism. Consequently, each document is not stored as 1 logical entity, but as a composite of smaller document parts. Printing is possible on a high quality high volume laser printer, enabling the creation of prototype documents and the production of a series of documents. The scanning and recognition component of the system scans documents and drawings (up to A0), converts them into the internal format, and stores them in the MMD. This conversion is carried out, where possible, by sophisticated pattern recognition modules so that minimum user assistance is required. In order to integrate SPRITE into existing environments, facilities for information acquisition is supplied with selected mainframe and computer aided design (CAD) systems. Information acquisition is supported both on the database access and file transfer levels .
Integration occurs at 2 levels: at the level of different components of the system, and at the level of the interface between the complete documentation system and the existing infrastructure at a cumstomer site.
The SPRITE system consists of six components: a multimedia database (text and graphics), a document processor, a scanning and recognition component, an information acquisition component, a printing component and a retrieval component. 

The central component of the system is a multimedia database (MMD), in which documents and information extracted from external sources as well as newly generated documents will be stored. Document versions and version dependencies between document parts will be maintained in the MMD. Searching in the MMD will be possible using a browser. The browser enables unstructured searching in the database by 'hopping' from one information entity to a related other, or by formulating a query. Technical documentation generally uses a large amount of data and has a relatively long life-cycle; both are reasons for supplying the MMD with mass storage capabilities, which will be accomplished by integration of an optical disk with the MMD. 

For document generation the system will have a multimedia WYSIWYG document processor, supporting both text and graphics editing. One of the important features of the document processor is its multi-author capability. Documents in technical environments, such as service manuals, are usually very large, and it is of great importance to support editing by several authors concurrently. This feature will be realised by assigning the document's parts to different authors and by supplying the MMD with a selective locking mechanism. Consequently, each document will not be stored as one logical entity, but as a composite of smaller document parts. Printing will be possible on a high-quality high-volume laser printer, enabling the creation of prototype documents and the production of a series of documents. 

Reusing existing information, both on paper and in electronic form, is well supported. The scanning and recognition component of the system scans documents and drawings (up to A0), converts them into the internal SPRITE format, and stores them in the MMD. This conversion will be carried out, where possible, by sophisticated pattern-recognition modules so that minimum user assistance will be required. In order to integrate SPRITE into existing environments, facilities for information acquisition will be supplied with selected mainframe and CAD systems. Information acquisition will be supported both on the database access and file transfer levels. 

SPRITE will pay special attention to integration at two levels: at the level of different components of the system, and at the level of the interface between the complete documentation system and the existing infrastructure at a customer site.";;;;;OCE NEDERLAND;NL;"KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT BRABANT;Universität Hamburg;Association pour la Recherche et le Développement de Méthodes et Processus Industriels (ARMINES);AEG Electrocom GmbH;Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG);CENTRAL INSTITUT OF CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION PROCESSES;Alcatel TITN;ORGA F A MEYER;DAIMLER-BENZ AG;UNIVERSITY OF DUBLIN;INTELLIBASE";"NL;DE;FR;IE;BE";

The overall aim has been to give an objective assessment of the potential for classification algorithms in solving significant commercial and industrial problems, and to widen the foundation for commercial exploitation of these and related algorithms both old and new.
This result describes the learning casual network algorithms and software currently being developed as part of the casual structures from inductive learning project (CASTLE), a software package which allows the user to learn the polytree's structure from raw data, to propagate knowledge throughout a polytree either interactively or in batch mode, to simulate data from a given casual network and to create and edit casual networks. CASTLE has been created to test and evaluate Bayesian learning algorithms. The user can edit a polytree, ie draw nodes, link them by arrows, give names to the nodes and cases, and define the conditional or marginal probabilities in each node. This option can be combined with a simulation process to offer a way of testing the performance of the algorithms implemented. Included in CASTLE is the possibility of propagating knowledge throughout a polytree. Using this module the learned net can be consulted to reason about the interpretation of specific input data. The interpretation process involves instantiating a set of variables corresponding to the input data, calculating its impact on the probabilities of a set of variables designated as hypotheses, and finally selecting the most likely combination of these hypotheses. There is now a batch version of CASTLE. This version allows the user to execute the learning algorithms in batch mode. The user can provide the program with a new type of file containing a set of samples of observed values of any variable but the last one (the one thought of as classifier). The program propagates the observed knowledge throughout the net and outputs a file containing the posterior probability of the cases of the classifier given the observed values of the rest of the variables.

The project involves the evaluation of the performance of machine learning algorithms on large scale, complex commercial and industrial problems. The overall aim is to give an objective assessment of the potential for machine learning algorithms in solving significant commercial and industrial problems, and to widen the foundation for commercial exploitation of these and related algorithms both old and new.
The 3 main approaches to decision problems are machine learning algorithms using decision trees, Bayesian methods of classical statistics and discrimination or regression methods generally. Partly due to the limited field of application of these methods, newer methods have emerged in response to new problems: relational learning algorithms deal with complex data in the form of rules; neural net algorithms mirror the behaviour of neural networks in the brain; while genetic algorithms solve problems by following an evolutionary path.

The main results expected are:
evaluation and comparison of the main artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms, with a full specification of their merits and demerits and their range of application;
establishment of an objective set of criteria for the evaluation and comparison of algorithms;
establishment of an interactive environment for comparative testing of classification algorithms;
establishments of a set of measures for datasets, by which the performance of algorithms can be predicted;
a draftmanuscript for a handbook of machine learning and statistical classification procedures, giving practical guidance for large scale complex classification problems in commerce and industry;
 an objective assessment of several novel techniques for controlling a simulated spacecraft model.

Progress has been made in the following areas:
an improved version of a neural network algorithm (back propagation) to incorporate the differing costs of wrong decisions;
proposals for incorporating decision costs into the learning and testing phases of machine learning algorithms;
an objective assessment of the performance of machine learning, neural net techniques and traditional forecasting techniques in the prediction of economic datasets.
Historically, the three main approaches to decision problems have been (i) machine learning algorithms using decision trees; (ii) Bayesian methods of classical statistics and (iii) discrimination or regression methods generally. Partly due to the limited field of application of these methods, more recent methods have emerged in response to new problems: relational learning algorithms deal with complex data in the form of rules; neural net algorithms are linked to the fascination of mankind with understanding and emulating the human brain; while genetic algorithms solve problems by following an evolutionary path. The fact that the various methods may sometimes be applied to the same dataset with contradictory results is partly due to their treatment of the data but is more to do with the different emphasis put on the classification/prediction/optimisation aspects of the problem. 

By testing around 23 algorithms from this list on about 22 large-scale and commercially important problems, this project has determined to what extent the various algorithms meet the needs of industry and has provided improved software designed to extend the commercial exploitation of advanced data analysis, including machine learning type algorithms. 

The objectives of the project have been to: 

- provide critical performance measurements, and criteria for measurement on available classification algorithms which will improve confidence in full exploitation 
- indicate the nature and scope for next-stage development which particular algorithms require to meet commercial performance expectations 
- indicate the most promising avenues of development for commercially immature approaches.";;;;;DAIMLER-BENZ AG;DE;"UNIVERSITAT DE GRANADA;UNIVERSIDAD DO PORTO;DEUTSCHE AEROSPACE AG;ISOFT;UNIVERSITY OF STRATHCLYDE;FRAUENHOFER-INSTITUT FÜR INFORMATIONS UND DATENVERARBEITUNG;TECHNISCHEN UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN;INSTITUT FÜR BIOPHYSIK UND KYBERNETIK DER UNIVERSITÄT LUBECK;Brainware Gesellschaft für Artificial Intelligence Systementwicklung und -beratung mbH;Turing Institute Ltd";"ES;PT;DE;FR;UK";

Sub-micron CMOS technologies were to be developed, demonstrated and qualified at the 0.7 micron (after 2 years) and 0.5 micron (after 4 years) levels. The reduction in dimensions was to be optimised to achieve very high packing density as well as very high speed for digital custom chips. Packing density targets were about 5000 logic gates/mm{2} in 0.7 micron CMOS and over 7000 in 0.5 micron CMOS.
The ACCES project provided European systems and information technology (IT) users with a multiple sourced, submicron complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process offering high packing densities and high speeds. The processes produced are state of the art CMOS application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technologies at 0.7 micron dimensions.

Following a demonstration at research scale of the 0.7 micron CMOS process, the process flow was installed in the various industrial sites.

The optimization of the 0.7 micron development is ongoing.
A prototyping status was achieved for every technology involved in the planned 0.7 micron process supporting the common design rules. These were demonstrated and are now available for exploitation. Commonality has been employed in the design rules, which should enable easy second sourcing of the technology. Several demonstrators were designed by the users in the consortium, including:
general purpose digital systolic neural network chip;
high density video codec;
ultra high speed asynchronous transmission (ATM) switch component for use in broadband integrated services digital network (ISDN);
composite array.
Due to the work and the involvement of the research centres, the project has also delivered very advanced results for further incorporation in the 0.5 micron technology.
The ACCES project provided European systems and IT users with a multiple-sourced, sub-micron CMOS process offering high packing densities and high speeds. The processes produced are state-of-the-art CMOS ASIC technologies at 0.7 micron dimensions. 

The partners in the consortium are proposing common design rules to their potential customers, resulting in a unique multi-sourcing capability. This approach is further enhanced by the specialisation of the partners in various production levels (from short cycle time prototyping through to high volume deliveries) and application areas (industrial, telecommunications, military, etc).";;;;;EUROPEAN SILICON STRUCTURES  S.A.;FR;"GEC Plessey Semiconductors plc;MIETEC;TELEFONICA;MATRA-MHS;STC Components;Centre National d'Études des Télécommunications (CNET);British Telecom plc (BT);Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum;Alcatel SEL AG";"UK;BE;ES;FR;DE";

The overall aim is to produce an HCI architecture and tool specifications for the implementation of adaptable user interfaces consistent with low-cost workstation technology. The study will cover several different application areas, but with the common themes of training for the use of future systems and improvements in user acceptance of new systems.

The particular concerns of the action are application systems with diverse groups of users requiring different modes of interaction according to their roles and levels of knowledge of the system, including integration of information from more than one application. The examples to be used in the study, for which small scale demonstrations based on existing software applications will be shown, are in the areas of: 

- hospital/medical information systems 
- training systems for numeric-controlled machine tool application 
- operation and maintenance training for complex software systems. 

The existing activities of consortium members in each of these areas will provide the initial extraction and collation of users' requirements, from which common themes will be distilled. The first of the two major action activities (definition of HCI architecture) will concentrate on the definition of user model structures in relation to the dialogue manager and its interface, including the role of knowledge-based components; presentation management is a secondary issue for the action, but will be consistent with current 'standard look and feel approaches. The work will also consider how information from distributed applications should be integrated into this architecture. 

The results of this first stage will the be used in the second major action activity, which will develop initial specifications of tools to enable rapid adaptation of instances of HCI by non-specialists in IT. As part of this process, the consortium has selected the three application domains listed above, where the combination of existing, available application software, current commercial activity, and knowledge of user needs will enable small-scale examples to be constructed, illustrating the architecture principles already identified. 

The consortium expects to exploit results of the study in their specific commercial application domains, primarily in terms of improvements in competitiveness and market knowledge arising from the ability to develop systems which are more acceptable to users and can be tailored to market sectors more efficiently. But the results will also be of wider benefit especially in the areas of CBT software and complex software systems where the needs of several groups of users, and their changes over a period of time, must be satisfied in an accessible and integrated manner.";;;;;MARI Applied Technologies Ltd;UK;"FRAUNHOFER INSTITUT FÜR SILICATFORSCHUNG;INFORMATIONS SYSTEME FÜR COMPUTERERINTEGRIERTE AUTOMATISIERUNG;University of Leeds;Thomson CSF";"DE;UK;FR";

The main goal of this project is to investigate this technique in greater detail and to identify feasible optimum active noise control systems for future practical applications.
The total project progressed extremely well. For the fixed wing aircraft group, for example, all laboratory and aircraft testing and all theoretical work could be performed as planned. In addition, the development of the two control units could be finished and finally very successfully flight tests as initially assumed. For the rotary wing aircraft group similar progress was made. Also in this group all experimental and theoretical work could be finished and successfully concluded in time. 

The established results of the project by far exceeded the expectation. They are documented in more then hundred reports and range from detailed theoretical results to practically oriented laboratory and full scale flight test data of all research sub-areas considered. For the future several scientific papers are planned to be published explaining more details of these research results. Two summary reports on the project with selected data have been published already
Following an evaluation of pertinent active noise control work, detailed theoretical and experimental research is performed. The research covers interior noise calculations and noise and vibration measurements in aircraft in flight and in a full scale fuselage  test section on the ground. Laboratory tests and investigations on promising new noise control transducers are included. Also, extensive work is performed on the development of optimum prototype active noise control systems. In the later phase of the study, these systems will be evaluated by ground and flight testing.

8220;1660;MOHAWC;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Models of Human Actions in Work Contexts;01/09/1989;31/05/1992;;"For the successful design and application of an information system in a modern, complex and rapidly changing work environment, system designers need to know the scope of work requirements and all possible means which agents may choose to satisfy them. Classical methods of field studies and behaviouristic studies are not, in practice, feasible ways of obtaining such knowledge. 
The overall objective of the MOHAWC Action was to formulate and extend a common framework for cognitive studies of human agents coping with complex environments. Work was focused on the following areas: 
-methods for the analysis and representation of knowledge about complex work domains (derived primarily from field studies and micro-world studies) 
-analysis of cognitive control, mental models and heuristics applied in complex work domains 
-distributed decision-making and forms of cooperative work 
-the role of tacit knowledge in agents' performance in complex work domains 
-computer simulation methods for testing models of cognitive performance.
A taxonomic framework has been developed for modelling human behaviour in complex work domains which can support the design of advanced information systems. The framework serves as a basis for the comparison, analysis and transfer of results and models derived from field studies of agents working in real life contexts and studies involving agents coping with computerized microworlds.

The 5 planned deliverables of the models of human actions in work context (MOHAWC) project are:
taxonomy for analysis of work domains (taxonomies for cognitive work analysis and for microworlds, that is, computer simulations of complex dynamic systems that are used as laboratory devices for investigating complex human behaviour);
cognitive processes and resources (cognitive simulations of operator behaviour based on both results from field studies and laboratory studies with microworlds;
distributed decision making (this focuses on the issue of distributed decision making in modern work and reports on results of both field studies and microworlds for the study of coordination among agents in dynamic contexts);
evaluations, simulations and models (this reports results from microworld experiments, simulations of cognitive behaviour with a focus on the representation of temporal aspects of dynamic systems);
MOHAWC separate papers (this contains a number of papers completed after the last workshop, including papers on the use of the MOHAWC taxonomy for interface design, further studies on distributed decision making, and papers that summarize results of field studies and simulations).

Together, these deliverables contribute to the understanding of cognitive aspects of modern work in high tech industry, providing new concepts in the taxonomies that have been developed.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The Action has drawn on a wide background of research carried out, mainly within national programmes, by each of the partner teams. The MOHAWC Action's work has been in the form of an integrating project, the efforts of which has been grouped into four research topics: 
-taxonomy of work domains 
-models of cognitive processes 
-distributed decision making and cooperative work 
-computer simulation based methods to test models of cognitive performance. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The five planned deliverables of the MOHAWC Action are now available. The first of these, 'Taxonomy for Analysis of Work Domains', is concerned with taxonomies for cognitive work analysis amd for 'microworlds', i.e. computer simulations of complex dynamic systems that are used as laboratory devices for investigating complex human behaviour. The second, 'Cognitive Processes and Resources', reports on the work in cognitive simulations of operator behaviour based on both results from field studies and labora  tory studies with microworlds. The third, 'Distributed decision making', focuses on the issue of distributed decision making in modern work and reports on results of both field studies and microworlds for the study of coordination among agents in dynamic contexts. The fourth, 'Evaluations, Simulations and Models', reports results from microworld experiments, simulations of cognitive behaviour with a focus on the representation of temporal aspects of dynamic systems. The fifth deliverable, 'MOHAWC separate papers', contains a number of papers completed after the last workshop, including papers on the use of the MOHAWC taxonomy for interface design, further studies on distributed decision making, and papers that summarise results of field studies and simula tions. 
Together, these deliverables contribute to the understanding of cognitive aspects of modern work in high-tech industry, providing new concepts in the taxonomies that have been developed and the accompanying general framework; new results from both field studies and the laboratory; new methods for laboratory work in the form of micro-worlds for a variety of purposes, including distributed decision making ans the testing of AI programs, and formal developments, especially for representing time and understanding time and complexity. The MOHAWC Action has thus provided a better foundation for the development of new information technology for modern work as well as methods that can be used for the evaluation of such technology. Especially important here are the results on adaptation and on the flexibility and variety of strategies that operators use. 
POTENTIAL 
The results from the various MOHAWC research paths show noticeable potential within the following areas: 
-formulation of requirements for design of information systems in support of users' adaptation in dynamic, complex work environments 
-formulation of a novel approach to 'design guidance'; this approach is based on the view of designers as being creative and adaptive decision makers who are relatively unconstrained by normative design rules";;;;;RISOE NATIONAL LABORATORY;DK;"Université de Paris XIII (Paris-Nord);Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;University of Manchester;ROSKILDE UNIVERSITET CENTER;UNIVERSITY OF UPPSALA";"FR;DE;BE;UK;DK;SE";

The integration of advanced operations research algorithms, knowledge representation methods and user interface management techniques is providing an innovative approach to this class of problems.
Representing the full complexity of routing and scheduling problems by means of mathematical models with algorithmic solutions is sometimes impossible. In these cases a routing and scheduling problem is best tackled by a decision support system (DSS). Planning of nonspecific transportation by an intelligent fleet expert (PONTIFEX) is a knowledge based DSS that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with operations research (OR) functions, tailored for applications in the field of fleet scheduling. It can be used by people with little or no experience of OR.

The planning of nonspecific transportation by an intelligent fleet expert (PONTIFEX) project developed an object oriented decision support framework for handling routing and scheduling problems, along with specific case studies in aircraft rotation and scheduling and the physical distribution domain. The integration of advanced operations research algorithms, knowledge representation methods and user interface management techniques provided an innovative approach to this class of problems.

Several prototype applications have been built with the aim of focusing on real user requirements, testing different technical approaches and software architectures, and identifying the most suitable development/deployment environment. These developments have resulted in a flexible application model that clearly separates a reusable skeleton, or framework, from specific domain knowledge and algorithms.

As part of the framework, mechanisms for handling data consistency, encapsulating software modules, and specialized user interface objects have been developed. The tools set of modules includes innovative methods for solving temporal constraint satisfaction problems, as well as clustering and routing algorithms.

The PONTIFEX software runs on Unix workstations under the Motif graphical interface, and is written in Prolog and C. The following major deliverables are bein completed:
a general application framework, the Pontifex Application Framework (PAF), that includes domain independent services for building user interfaces, managing data consistency, and controlling the logic flow of execution;
a number of self contained domain oriented software modules (each module tackles 1 particular subproblem in the application area);

The INTREPID project is linked to ROCKI (project 5376). The planned recognition system must cope with a mixture of texts, line graphics, headings and grey-scale images, and with a variety of character sizes, styles and print qualities. Advanced distributed computer hardware will be used so that the increased requirements of new recognition algorithms and strategies can be satisfied.

INTREPID is aiming to: 

- Develop new advanced preprocessing and character classification strategies and their implementation, together with existing approaches, in order to process poor-quality documents more successfully. 
- Improve reading results by advanced post-processing functions incorporating document layout analysis and linguistic-based approaches. The results of the ROCKI project on decomposing documents into different regions of interest will be taken into account. 
- Employ algorithmic procedure and recognition strategies, which can be particularly effective when supported by an appropriate hardware/software architecture. In order to show this, suitable algorithms will be chosen, implemented, tested and modified on a distributed parallel hardware architecture. 
- Demonstrate the results in suitable development environments (PC, workstation or dedicated hardware) and in an application specifically developed for the automatic classification of office documents. 

The main workpackages can be grouped into four categories: 

From Preprocessing to Postprocessing 

- working out strategies, procedures and algorithms in the field of preprocessing andclassification, suitable for supporting the recognition of poor-quality office documents 
- developing structural algorithms for text recognition and line graphic analysis 
- analysing the format and layout of office documents.

The general scope of the program was the improvement of methodologies and prediction methods for interactional aerodynamics, in order to provide benefits in the helicopter design phase.

The computational methods available to predict isolated helicopter main rotor flow, isolated fuselage flow and rotor/fuselage interaction phenomena were discussed.

The experimental activities to generate new data covered a wide spectrum to meet the needs of the code validation process. The tests included:
isolated rotor (subscale) in hover and forward flight;
fuselage alone;
rotor/fuselage (subscale) in hover and forward flight;
rotor/fuselage (subscale) in forward flight.

Isolated and uncoupled rotor calculations were performed. The different methods used covered a wide range of theoretical approaches, from the simplest momentum theory to the boundary element method with a free wake rotor calculations. The correlations showed that at least a lifting line method with a vortex rotor wake is necessary to simulate correctly the velocity field above the rotor disk.

Isolated and uncoupled fuselage calculations were performed using methods. Correlations with the experiment were satisfactory.

The combined rotor/fuselage calculation methods typically use a lifting line representation for the rotor with a prescribed wake model and a steady panel method for the fuselage. The calculated results obtained show relatively good agreement with the experiment above the rotor disk for the mean and instantaneous velocities.

A global rotorcraft model based on the boundary element method has been formulated and preliminary results have been presented. A panel method representation of the fuselage and of the thick blades isused along with a prescribed rotor wake model. The modelling tools developed in the project need to be improved in order to increase the range of configurations for which they provide reliable calculations.
It will commence with a survey to identify and compare the computational methods currently available to European industry and research centres. 

Experimental campaigns will be carried out using 3 different wind-tunnel test facilities. The test matrix and the most significant measurements for each campaign will be specified, such as the measurements required for CFD purposes. 

The complete rotor/fuselage interactional aerodynamics problem will be outlined, from the computational point of view, by addressing some intermediate topics: firstly, the isolated rotor and fuselage analysis will be considered; secondly, the uncoupled rotor and fuselage case (the flowfield of the former analysis taking into account the presence of the latter, and vice versa); thirdly, the coupled rotor/fuselage case (combining rotor and fuselage flowfield calculations); and finally, global integrated models. For each topic, the following aspects will be covered: the methods and the algorithms to be assessed, using selected test cases from the updated experimental database; the improvements/enhancements needed for each method and algorithm; and the possible development of new computational models.

The platform will exploit the recent significant advances in Open Systems standards, such as X.400 1988, the Pedi protocol, FTAM/ROSE/RPC, and UN/EDIFACT syntax and message designs. By basing the development on Unix the platform will have wide applicability as the basis of prototype products for both software houses and equipment vendors. Organisations developing their own applications to use EDI will benefit especially from the definition of the CHALENGE EDI Application Programming Interface (API). This definition will be submitted offered to the appropriate international standardisation bodies. 

The project will collect and analyse users' requirements for application control and the monitoring of the sending, receipt and translation of EDI messages. User organisations from several business and commercial sectors will be consulted and the CHALENGE EDI API defined from an analysis of their responses. 

The results of previous studies, such as GAUCHO (project 2563), will be researched and incorporated in the project and the software design. The software will then be built to link applications from host machine to host machine over network services through the CHALENGE EDI API, with management, message translation and communications functions handled by the platform. This software will run on a number of host machine/vendor Unix engine configurations, reflecting current and foreseen market needs. 

The functionality of the CHALENGE EDI API and CHALENGE platform will be tested, demonstrated and promoted in the same trade sectors from which user organisations were drawn in the initial analysis of requirements. Demonstrations will aim to use existing Community-wide X.400 network services, especially the Y-NET service. 

CHALENGE platform's development and demonstration will also contribute to the growth of EDI in the internal market, showing the more standardised and cost-effective linkage possible between many types of host application machine.

8258;3279;ACCOR;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Articulatory-Acoustic Correlations in Coarticulatory Processes: a Cross-Language Investigation;01/04/1989;31/05/1992;;"Recent theoretical and experimental work on speech production strongly indicates the need for a comprehensive cross-language programme of basic research to expand knowledge of the language-specific and language-independent regularities involved. 
For many applications in speech technology the availability of an articulatory representation of speech utterances would mean substantial progress. For example, in the automatic recognition of continuous speech one of the major barriers to robust speaker-independent systems has been the great variability in the relationship between the acoustic level of representation and the phonological structure of a given utterance. 
However, the variability can itself become a productive source of information if the underlying physiological and linguistic constraints of the dynamics of articulation can be modelled, and this is the goal of the ACCOR Action. The main source of systematic variability at the segmental level is undoubtedly coarticulation, the main focus of the work.
Modelling of the underlying physiological and linguistic constraints on the dynamics of articulation during speech production was undertaken. A cross-language study of coarticulation identified the major language-independent universal regularities of the phenomenon and how they interact with language-specific factors. Investigation of coarticulatory regularities were integrated with new and improved ways of exploiting these regularities in deriving articulatory representations from the acoustic analysis of speech. Hardware and software were developed for digital recording of articulatory and acoustic data. A PC-based prototype of a multichannel speech workstation has been designed. Research was conducted into the instrumental investigation of articulatory activity. A review was made of connected speech processes in English, French, German and Italian. A core lexicon for English, French, German, Italian, Gaelic Irish, Catalan and Swedish has been established, consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant nonsense words, real words matching the phonetic structure of the nonsense words as closely as possible, and sentences illustrating the main connected speech processes in different languages. A complete set of articulatory, aerodynamic and acoustic recordings is available involving 5 speakers of each language. A common methodology has been adopted for segmenting and labelling the data. It is based on a nonlinear and independent annotation of the articulatory and acoustic events. Articulatory and acoustic data were interpreted in terms of an integrated production model.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
A cross-language approach was adopted in the ACCOR Action as a means of identifying the major language-independent universal regularities of the phenomenon (aspects such as mass, inertia and elasticity of the speech organs, the mechanical linkages betweenthem and the neuromuscular complexities of the cranial nervous system), and how they interact with language-specific factors such as the phonological rules of the languages concerned. 
Work began by examining the activities of the major physiological systems underlying speech production: the respiratory system (producing a flow of air), the laryngeal system (modifying the airflow by the valving mechanism of the vocal folds), and the complex supraglottal structures in the mouth and nose (such as the tongue, lips, jaw and soft palate, which shape the vocal tract into different resonating cavities). 
In addition, by examining the details of a given articulatory process for a number of different languages, ACCOR aimed to determine how such processes differ according to different phonological systems, and thus to be in a position to investigate interactions between the two sources of variation. A common methodology, standardised investigation tools and measurement procedures at specified locations in the speech signal have been adopted. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS OF OCTOBER 1991 
Deliverables and papers cover the following areas: 
-Hardware and software development for digital recording of articulatory and acoustic data. A PC-based prototype of a multichannel speech workstation has been designed. This equipment will be commercially available in early 1992. 
-Research into the instrumental investigation of articulatory activity. 
-Review of connected speech processes in English, French, German and Italian. 
-A core lexicon for English, French, German, Italian, Gaelic Irish, Catalan and Swedish has been established, consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant nonsense words; real words matching the phonetic structure of the nonsense words as closely as possible; and sentences illustrating the main connected speech processes in different languages.

POTENTIAL 
This Action integrates investigations into coarticulatory regularities with research into new and improved ways of exploiting these regularities in deriving articulatory representations through the acoustic analysis of speech.

The proposed method provides a sound technical solution to the current problem, has an evolution path already documented in the use of mathematical languages for verification and, most importantly, provides all the research and development in advanced telecommunications technologies in Europe (RACE) members with a mechanism for ensuring that their assumptions, views and concerns feed into the reference models and so allow consensus to be achieved.
BEST achieved an improved methodological recommendation supporting the requirements capture and functional specification of IBC reference model. The project also developed some notations for conceptual models for projects within the RACE community. The BEST method has been exemplified and elucidated by use of a theoretical worked example, namely, the connection system. This played an important part in the project's internal validation of its recommendations.

Technical Summary  

The study lasted for two years and the major task for the BEST project in its second year was to apply the method in practice and to disseminate its results a wider forum. Many workshops and seminars have been held to assist other RACE projects in the use of the method.  The experience gained in applying the BEST method to real problems resulted in updates, refinements and corrections to the handbook published.  

The proposed method provides a sound technical solution to the 'current problem', has an evolution path already documented in the use of mathematical languages for verification and, most importantly, provides all the RACE members with a mechanism for ensuring that their assumptions, views and concerns feed into the reference models and so allow consensus to be achieved.  

BEST achieved an improved methodological recommendation supporting the requirements capture and functional specification of IBC reference model.  The project also developed some notations for conceptual models for Part I projects within the RACE community.  

The BEST method has been exemplified and elucidated by use of a theoretical worked example: 'The Connection System'.  This played an important part in the project's internal validation of its recommendations.  

In addition, a specification of an example FRM function has been produced in close collaboration with other RACE projects, namely: R1044/1.1 FRM, R1044/1.2 CSF and R1024 NETMAN.  A detailed description of this practical worked example can be found in Deliverable 5: 'The Authorisation Worked Example'.

Many production requirements must be addressed for this increased integration, but central among these is lithography and pattern transfer, since these strategic techniques define the minimum feature size and packing density of the new devices. 

The overall objective of the project was to develop the equipment and basic processes required for a high-throughput pattern definition capability with 0.25 micron resolution that can be applied in the manufacturing process of all types of semiconductor devices. A modular concept was envisaged, which can be configured to meet the production needs of the full range of devices from high-volume memories to low-volume ASICs.
The objective of the project was to develop the equipment and basic processes required for a high throughput pattern definition capability with 0.25 micron resolution that can be applied in the manufacturing process of all types of semiconductor devices.

A prototype of the deep ultraviolet (UV) stepper was realized and tested, featuring 5x reduction all quartz optics. A new alignment system, operating through the lens with direct reference to the reticle, was incorporated. Due to this improved feature a high overlay accuracy, better than 125 nm, has been demonstrated.
The projection system has demonstrated resolution capability of 0.35 micron with single layer resist and 0.25 micorn with top surface imaging resist. All imaging specifications, including field uniformity and distortion, are within the requirements for subhalfmicron lithography. The thoroughput of the system compares favourably with the state of the art worldwide. An overlay accuracy of 60 nm has been realized.
2 single layer resist materials were under development. A negative resist has been developed with a resolution capability of 0.35 micron. In view of user requirements, the development concentrated on a positive tone material, which is now under test. In parallel, a bilayer resist system (CARL) has been developed, requiring more complex processing. Resolution of 0.25 micron has been demonstrated. Studies on how to integrate the deep UV wafer stepper with respect to environmental control (contamination, temperature) and interfacing (reticle management, automation) have been completed.
More specifically, this project aimed to develop the equipment, materials and techniques necessary for delineation of sub-halfmicron patterns. Included were a deep UV wafer stepper prototype, compatible photoresist systems (together with a study into the necessary resist processing), automation, and environmental aspects (with the goal of process integration in mind). 

The project comprised three interdependent work packages covering the development of: 

- a deep UV wafer stepper with excimer laser (248 nm) illumination 
- deep UV photoresists compatible with 248 nm illumination 
- automation and environmental engineering for the integration of equipment, especially of the deep UV stepper, in the clean-room.";;;;;ASM LITHOGRAPHY;NL;"Siemens AG;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);HOECHST AG;FRAUNHOFER INSTITUT FÜR SILICATFORSCHUNG;CARL ZEISS GMBH";"DE;NL;FR";

The project addressed the problem of speech based cooperative dialogue as an interface for computer based information services. The main technologies to be developed are continuous speech recognition and understanding, and oral dialogue modelling and management.

The project started with a number of definition studies for the general architecture and studies of application scenarios. A common architecture has been defined, together with the interfaces between the major modules.
A small 50 word vocubulary for the telephone speaker independent recognizer has been developed, suitable for a banking by phone application. Tests on the recognizer using the recognizer sensitivity analysis (RSA) technique have shown 95.6% correct recognition on the RSA 31 word vocabulary.

Preliminary results for the acoustic phonetic decoding module show that continuous density HMMs (CDHMM) achieve 77.6% word accuracy on sentences compared to 68.5% for discrete density HMMs using 275 phonetic units for the Italian language and a near 1000 word vocabulary. These results are for speaker independent recognition of telephone quality sentences, but do not take into account the effect of the linguistic processing module on sentence understanding performance.
Results for the English language using CDHMM show that phoneme recognition accuracy on the DARPA TIMIT database is comparable to that achieved by Kai-Fu Lee in the Carnegie Mellon SPHINX system.
A common dialogue manager architecture has been defined and work is in progress on its implementation.
Speech input will be sentences of naturally spoken utterances of telephone quality with a vocabulary of 1000-2000 words for each application. The grammar will be based on a subset of the four partners' languages (English, French, German and Italian). The project has begun with speaker-independent recognition of sub-word units. The second phase will consider automatic online speaker adaptation with a view to improving performance. The dialogue manager will allow users to express themselves in a restricted natural language. 

Prototypes will demonstrate the technology for three main information service applications: intercity train timetables (German), flight enquiries and reservations (English and French) and a hotel database (Italian). The spoken language phenomena to be covered will be determined from analysis of both human dialogue corpora as well as human-machine simulations. Each demonstration system will be evaluated through extensive user trials. 

For all demonstrators, the project has to define a common general architecture, common formalisms for grammar representation across languages, and common semantic representations for dialogue management and message generation.";;;;;Logica Ltd;UK;"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);CNET France Télécom;SIEMENS AG;Sarin Telematica SpA;DAIMLER-BENZ AG;POLITECNICO DI TORINO;CAP Gemini Innovation;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg";"FR;DE;IT";

The project addresses an acute need of the growing community of researchers, developers and systems integrators who are exploiting object oriented distributed systems architectures and platforms. This need is for instrumentation and visualization tools that reflect and exploit the rich composition and abstraction features of these distributed platforms. Such capabilities are essential at the critical systems integration stage of the system life cycle. They are also highly valuable as a basis for rapid prototyping, requirements structuring and evaluation of new applications and for the management of distributed applications and systems in operation. Finally, such tools may be used both for training purposes and to demonstrate the advantages of object oriented architectures as platforms for developing distributed applications.

The project addresses the needs identified above by developing a set of effective highly configurable tools for instrumentation of distributed applications. The prototype instrumentation system, Demon,developed during the communication systems architecture (CSA) project has been enhanced and ported onto the integrated systems architecture (ISA) testbench for exposure to the ISA user community. Pilot studies are being carried out addressing particular instrumentation needs and results are being used to refine the generic Demon infrastructure and to develop metatools to ease configuration in specific environments and use within a range of application domains.

The overall project objectives are to: develop new, better suited group III and V precursors for metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) growth applications. The precursor studies aim to identify new source materials which provide both improved operational characteristics (primarily vapour pressure, stability and toxicity) and also reduced unintentional impurity uptake in the resulting epitaxial layers; and to appraise the new CBE technique for the growth of advanced III-V demonstrator devices such as gallium arsenide/gallium aluminium arsenide and gallium arsenide/gallium indium phosphide heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) in order to allow direct comparison with corresponding devices produced using the present generation molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and MOVPE growth processes. Alternative new liquid organic precursors have been synthesized and characterized. Studies on biphosphinoethane (BPE) or tertiary butyl phosphine (TBP) and tertiary butyl arsine (TBAs) had led to the conclusion that state of the art, highly uniform multiple quantum well (MQW) laser structures can be grown using these much safer precursors.
Diethyl-aluminium-hydride-trimethylamine (DEAlH-NMe3) appears to be the best suited new aluminium precursor, with higher vapour pressure than TEAL (x 5), and low carbon and oxygen contamination when tested in CBE.
Studies on indium prescursors concentrated on dimethylaminopropy-dimethyl-indium (DADI). This compound is a promising candidated, being liquid at room temperature and having a high vapour pressure comparable to that of TEIn. High quality indium phosphide has been reproducibly grown with best low temperature mobilities of u(77 k) greater than 110000 cm{2} V{-1} s{-1}.
Preliminary experiments have been conducted on the growth of gallium indium phosphide with TBP. As observed in the case of indium phosphide, carbon concentrations are strongly reduced by using TBP instead of phosphide. No significant differ ence is noted for the sulphur, silicon and oxygen levels.
High n-type doping of CBE gallium arsenide and gallium indium phosphide has been successfully achieved using concentrated sources of disilane and hydrogen sulphide. Thanks to its higher incorporation efficiency with lower memory effect, hydrogen sulphide preferred to disilane as n-type dopant for both gallium arsenide and gallium indium phosphide. An ultra-high level gallium arsenide p-type doping capability has also been established using the TMGa precursor for specific application to the base region of the HBT device.

8725;5397;SPIRIT-2;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;The Spirit Workstation: a High-Performance Multifunction Technical Workstation;05/12/1988;04/12/1992;;"The SPIRIT Workstation project aims to design and build a high-performance workstation to support computationally demanding activities in computer-aided engineering, image processing, graphical interaction, modelling and simulation. The project also aims to facilitate the development of advanced applications software. The industrial partners intend to market a commercial product based on the prototypes developed within the project, and expect to establish a position of dominance in the high-performance end of the European workstation market by the mid-1990s.
In exploiting parallelism in every aspect of both the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics subsystems, the TWS88 combines the performance of a top of the range computing workstation with exceptional 3-dimensional graphics performance to form a scalable deskside system. 

The system offers: 
24 plane colour display (true colour) with double buffering and the acceleration of 3-dimensional graphics; 
adoption of PHIGS libraries and the PEX Protocol, 3-dimensional extension to X-Windows; 
compliance with the VME standard which allows the integration of a large number of industrial boards, (TWS88 is one of the only UNIX graphics workstations that supports applications in an industrial environment); 
compliance with the UNIX SVR4 operating system, X/OPEN standards, POSIX and SVID; 
standard communication capacities (TCP/IP, ISO, X25, RNIS, FDDI); 
compliance with 88open, BSC/OCS, enabling a choice of more than 1500 software packages. 

TWS88 is characterized by hardware and software architecture which makes greater use of the client/server model than any other graphics workstation. 
The 2-dimensional graphics software (X11, MOTIF) and its 3-dimensional extensions (PEX, PHIGS, GIL) are executed for the most part in the graphics subsystems which have their own processors and working memories. Because of this, a graphics application demands very little of the central processor leaving it available for calculation tasks or input/output. 
TWS88 thus offers the new concept of graphics server. This concept allows several internal graphics subsystems to be combined with the same central unit, as well as X-Windows terminals on the Ethernet network, without decreasing the graphics performances on the different screens. The performance cost ratio of such a graphics multiuser solution is the most advantageous in the industry.
The SPIRIT Workstation will provide 50-1000 MIPS and 25-500 Mflops, with data rates capable of transmitting real-time video or providing real-time 3-D graphical interaction. The workstation will have a multiprocessor design, communicating over an industry standard bus with a bandwidth capability of 300 - 500 Mbytes/s. Facilities for high-performance video will be provided. The software base will include an industry-standard, heterogeneous, multiprocessor Unix system, augmented with powerful CASE and object-oriented programming environments, all implemented to be capable of integration with computer network facilities. 

The system software will be implemented with advanced software technology, including an operating system kernel suitable for tightly coupled multiprocessor working. The design will not be restricted to a homogeneous system; support for heterogeneity is regarded as the key prerequisite for the ability to incorporate new processor technologies as they appear. 

To achieve the wide range of capabilities envisaged without incurring unnecessary costs, the hardware architecture will be modular, with high performance in the areas of graphics and image processing achieved with special-purpose hardware subsystems which could be omitted from any particular machine. The sharing of development and software costs means that the workstation as a whole will be cheaper to develop than would a range of specialised machines directed at narrower market segments. 

A fundamental result of the SPIRIT Workstation project will be to assist European industry in achieving at least parity with non-European competitors at the high-performance end of the workstation market. This will not only provide a good position for progressing to more advanced products in the mid to late 1990s, but will also provide a base to support the migration of high-end technology to lower cost machines throughout the decade. 

The graphics performance will be substantially improved through using ASICs, and an extension of the graphics interface layer will be implemented for higher quality rendering including ray-tracing, radiosity and better behaviour mechanisms. Cross-programming tools and an executive environment for the graphics subsystem will be implemented in order to provide maximum versatility to graphics application developers. 

A PostScript pre-viewer will be provided in order to facilitate the production of high-quality documents. The graphics developments aim to provide the High Performance Graphics Subsystem (HPGS) of the SPIRIT Workstation. This graphics subsystem, integrated with the multiprocessor heterogeneous Unix system, will offer the competitive functionality necessary in a high-performance technical workstation. In addition, it is intended that the HPGS will be capable of incorporation into other workstations based on FutureBus\ and marketed as separate boards for specific applications. The graphics interface layer will allow the rapid and efficient porting of newly emerging graphics standards. X-WINDOWS, PEX, and PHIGS\ will all be implemented on the SPIRIT Workstation.

8201;3066;AMODEUS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Assimilating Models of Designers, Users and Systems;01/09/1989;31/05/1992;;"The aims of AMODEUS were to: 
-develop formal models of the behaviour of interactive systems as a means of formulating claims about usability and for generating interactive software architectures 
-formulate explicit cognitive models of user behaviour and to represent them in a manner that enables cognitive theory to be migrated into design practice 
-study how interface designers reason about interface properties and usability 
-develop a notation, called a design rationale, to represent design options and their properties 
-explore inter-relationships among conceptions of user behaviour, system behaviour and designs, and to examine their integration.
Interdisciplinary approaches to the study of user/system interactions were developed using cognitive models of users, formal representations of system behaviour, and their refinement into interactive system architectures. Interface designers were studied and representations developed to support design decision making.

The system modelling activity was extended significantly to include graphical and cooperative systems. An agent notation was developed that draws together the basic theoretical models with the practical requirements of object oriented interactive system design. The interactive architectures work made significant progress towards heuristics for agent based design of interactive systems. An expert system embodying such heuristics is 1 of several proof of concept demonstrations.

Work in both forms of user modelling has significantly extended the scope of available techniques. In one approach, technique based around the concept of the designer's intended procedure has also been developed where the instruction language for a programmable user architecture is interactively applied and run within the architecture to reveal behavioural consequences of a design. In the other approach a proof of concept expert system has been developed to model the cognitive activity of users and provide design advice across a significant range of topics.

The design rationale developed a particular representation for supporting design activity. Many design scenarios have now been analysed and the representation has been used to integrate over user, system and other criteria.

Cognitive and system modellers have continued to develop an interaction framework for synthesizing over areas, and a number of other notational frameworks and ideas for interdisciplinary integration were developed.

The results of the system architecture modelling activity performed in the context of the project have been assessed. The goal of this research package is to provide insights and effective guidelines for designing and implementing interactive software. Although multiagent models are considered to be a promising way of supporting human factors as well as software engineering requirements, they are hard to apply. The description of the overall architecture of an interactive system has been clarified, making explicit the boundaries with the functional core and the presentation toolkit, two components considered by programmers as unavoidable constraints. The dialogue controller has been refined into a number of agents modelled along two dimensions: facets and levels of abstractions. The combination of these two axes is a convenient way of describing phenomena observed from current practices. Several heuristic rules have been identified, which provide useful insights and guidance for the definition of relationships between agents.

The goal of the project is to develop interdisciplinary approaches to studying human computer interaction and to move towards applying the results to the practicalities of design. One of the approaches the project is taking to represent design is design space analysis. One of its goals is to help bridge the gap from relatively theoretical concerns to the practicalities of design. Design space analysis is a central component of a framework for representing the design rationale for designed artifacts. The current work focuses more specifically on the design of user interfaces. A design space analysis is represented using the QOC notation, which consists of questions identifying key design issues, options providing possible answers to the questions, and criteria for assessing and comparing the options. An overview of the approach is given. Some examples of the research issues currently under consideration are provided.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The research was an inter-disciplinary collaboration which drew upon concepts and tools from software engineering, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence. 
Within the system modelling research, emphasis was upon the precise specification of abstract properties governing interactions and on the means of inter-relating and refining such properties into actual interactive software architectures. Exemplar systems provided the material for analysis. User modelling explored techniques for representing cognitive theory in the context of design. One technique involved the development of an instruction language for a programmable user model, the other required the develoment of an expert system that reasons about the properties human cognition in user-system interaction. Both experimental evidence and evidence drawn from scenarios of user behaviour were used to support theory development. 
The design rationale work describes and specifies options within a space of possible designs. Both system and user properties are represented within this technique, as are the criteria for choosing among options. As with the system modelling work, different exemplars were analysed. Using empirical protocol and questionnaire techniques, the Action also studied how designers reason about interfaces in commercial design projects. 
The project was integrated through the use of a structured methodology in which researchers from different perspectives provided analyses of a common and systematically sampled set of scenarios describing user system exchanges and design options. The input from the different perspectives was analysed, contrasted and integrated. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The results of the complete Action are described in 23 deliverables. Over the course of the project: 
The scope of the Action's system modelling activity was extended significantly to include graphical and co-operative systems. An agent notation was developed that draws together the basic theoretical models with the practical requirements of object oriented interactive system design. The interactive architectures work made significant progress towards heuristics for agent based design of interactive systems. An expert system embodying such heuristics is one of several proof-of-concept demonstrations resulting from the Action. 
Work in both forms of user modelling has significantly extended the scope of our available techniques. In one approach, technique based around the concept of 'the designer's intended procedure' has also been developed. In this technique, the instruction language for a programmable user architecture is interactively applied and run within the architecture to reveal behavioural consequences of a design. In the other approach a proof-of-concept expert system has been developed to model the cognitive activityof users and provide design advice across a significant range of topics. 
The design rationale developed a particular representation for supporting design activity. Many design scenarios have now been analysed and the representation has been used to integrate over user, system and other criteria. The design related research hasalso reported on a number of laboratory and field studies in which real designers deal with their own designs or discuss the same scenario material that has been analysed by the user and system modellers within the Action. 
With respect to the integration of ideas from the different perspectives within the project, three sets of communal analyses were carried out. Each approach within the project analysed the same set of basic material. Cognitive and system modellers have continued to develop an 'interaction framework' for synthesising over areas, and a number of other notational frameworks and ideas for interdisciplinary integration were developed. 
POTENTIAL 
The research has forced significant extensions to the scope of our modelling techniques. By relating these developments directly to design practice and providing a number of proof of concept demonstrations, the project should have provided the wider HCI community with a firm foundation to build systematic bridges both between different theoretical approaches and from these approaches to the realities of commercial design practise.";;;;;MRC Applied Psychology Unit;UK;"KOBENHAVNS UNIVERSITET;University of York;Université de Grenoble I (Université Joseph Fourier);Logica Ltd;Rank Xerox EuroParc Ltd;Alcatel SEL AG";"DK;UK;FR;DE";

The objective of this project is the development of a multichamber batch reator in which interpoly silicon oxide and silicon nitride films, combined in a so-called oxynitride oxide (ONO) configuration, can be produced in one reactor system.
The construction of a Mark 1 prototype and its installationm were accomplished by the end of 1990. Etching rates and surface concentrations (by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and wettability) have been investigated under a wide variety of process conditions to assess process uniformity on the same wafer and from wafer to wafer on complete batches, as well as to evaluate run to run reproducibility. The objective of establishing a process whereby native oxide is removed over a batch of 25 wafers without significant etching of other oxides on the wafers has been achieved. It has also been shown that the oxygen content can be reduced to a fraction of a monolayer and the surface is well passivated against reoxidation. In addition metallic contamination studies have revealed no increase of copper, nickel or iron on wafers run in the high frequency (HF) vapour reactor as compared to control wafers.
Electrical tests on capacitors fabricated with the Mark 1 oxide as dielectric have repeatedly demonstrated that, compared to conventional wet etching techniques, the in situ HF vapour preetch of the native oxide prior to its bottom dry oxidation process does provide superior vertical characteristics of the bottom oxide. Equally important for advanced ONO deposition, where further shrinkage of the dielectric's thickness is required, is the control and optimization of the nitride film deposition process. For this, the Mark 1 prototype has demonstrated its excellent capabilities. For the first time it has been possible to study the nitride deposition kinetics on clean (ie native oxide free) silicon surfaces. For the ONO application, in particular, it has been concluded that: the novel nitride process developed in the Mark 1 system prod uces films that are already continuous below 30 augstrom and that compared to conventional processing, the clustered oxide nitride (ON) process in Mark 1 provides better control.
To demonstrate the superior electrical characteristics of ONO films grown in such a reactor, state of the art erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) and electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) structures with a dielectric stack in the range of 20-30 nm are being manufactured and tested. For purposes of comparison electrical evaluation of different ONO recipes has been performed using a dedicated test pattern for 4 Mbit EPROM, in order to find the best interpoly dielectric characteristics which can be obtained in conventional furnaces.

In state-of-the-art devices, interpoly ONO films are implemented in the floating gate structure of EPROM and EEPROM devices. Following the development of higher circuit integration and the corresponding reduction in dielectrics thickness, it appears that the integrity of the interfaces between the various layers will soon become the limiting factor in the electrical performance (electrical defect density, charge retention) of future devices. It is thus important that the dielectric structure is deposited in a single vacuum system, preventing the wafers from coming into contact with air, before the capacitive structure is completed. In the latter case, in fact, the resulting uncontrolled growth of native oxide films combined with the exposure of the surfaces to chemical contaminants would lead to the degradation of the interface quality in an unreproducible way, adversely affecting the electrical characteristics of the devices.";;;;;ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL;NL;"Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);Thomson Microelectronics Srl (SGS)";"FR;IT";

In particular the environment has to support applications in the area of Human Computer Cooperative Work, which require a high level of cooperation among collections of multidimensionally distributed, heterogeneous autonomous agents, including humans.
The analysis of various application scenarios has led to a conceptual framework required to build multiagent systems in different domains. The basic concepts are: a communication framework for the underlying information flow between agents, an agent formalism providing a description level for individual agents, and a cooperation methods to support a wide variety of cooperation styles. 

Based upon the concept formalization the multiagent language MAIL has been developed, defining and implementing the fundamental basic loop of an agent allowing for the definition of a wide variety of agents, their respective communication capabilities and cooperative behaviour. 

As a result of a conceptual prototyping approach an integrated environment has been developed comprizing a first version of MAIL and the tool architecture.

14338;FI2T0014;MAGIC;;FP2-TELEMAN;;FP2;TELEMAN 20 : manipulator and gantry intelligent control;01/10/1990;30/09/1992;;"Objectives  

The major objective of ' TELEMAN 20 - MAGIC' was to extend the existing state of the art in computer aided teleoperation and remote handling using cranes, gantry systems and large computer controlled serving systems. In particular the knowledge gained was to be of specific value to operations planned for hazardous or disordered nuclear environments. Many of the systems and techniques developed under this proposal were also to be appropriate to more generally mobile equipment mounted, for example, on vehicles, and for normal operations in existing nuclear plants, including reactors.
The existing state of the art in computer aided teleoperation and remote handling is being extended using cranes, gantry systems and large computer controlled serving systems.
Two bilateral input devices: a Cartesian minimaster arm (CARMA) and a serial link input device, were developed and tested with a Puma 560 robot. To improve the teleoperator interface, software was generated to enable smooth motion through a singularity. Force control algorithms were developed to support the robotic execution of contact tasks: drilling, sawing, and bolting and unbolting. A geometric controller to provide resolved motion control of an n-axis manipulator was designed. To handle redundant degrees of freedom the auxiliary control strategies 'mid range', 'snaking', and 'collision avoidance' were implemented. A semi autonomous controller (SAC), which resides architecturally one level above these subsystems, was designed to coordinate different subsystems, facilitate operator intervention, monitor system data, and validate operator commands. In performance trials the SAC was used to control the remote connection of a bolted flange.
Exploitation
With the exception of the Geometric Controller, which will be used by Nuclear Electric to control its redundant degrees of freedom manipulator in maintenance operations in its nuclear power plants, all of the above building blocks are being incorporated into the TELEMAN TM 48 - INGRID robust gantry-mounted tele-manipulator research machine project. CARMA has been commericalised by AEA as a product for use in nuclear remote handling applications and KfK plans to use the SAC in a number of internal and external projects. Singularity control has now been installed as a core facility in AEA's commercial telerobotic controller.
Work to be done  

The work was to be divided into seven areas:     

1-bilateral input devices for teleoperators (AEA Harwell, Univ. Newcastle)    
2-telerobotic controller for industrial robots adapted to nuclear teleoperation. (AEA Harwell) 
3-semi-autonomous and overall control, graphic simulation and decision aids for task planning and execution. (Siemens, AEA Harwell, KfK, Univ. Hannover) 
4-generalised geometric controller for teleoperated and autonomous control of any manipulator via a stereographic workstation. (Nuclear Electric) 
5-partitioning of coordinated robot, manipulator and gantry control system (AEA Harwell, Univ. Hannover) 
6-force control and mode switching for autonomous sub-tasks (Univ. Newcastle) 
7-force and force-rate sensors for robust force  control. (Univ. Newcastle) 

Test strategy    

Each sub-system was to undergo prototype or simulation testing according to the application. Integration and field testing in nuclear environments was to form the basis of the TELEMAN TM48 INGRID research machine project.";;;;CSC;United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA);UK;"Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Technik und Umwelt GmbH;Siemens AG;UNIVERSITAET HANNOVER;UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;Nuclear Electric plc";"DE;UK";
17062;A 1018 (8220);AEMI;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Advanced Environment for Medical Image Interpretation;;;;"3 main research themes in the field of computer aided medical image interpretation have been investigated:
analysis of its role in medical practice, leading to a definition of clinical requirements;
development of a formalism for human computer interaction, leading to the definition of a user model;
exploration of technical options for implementation, leading to the definition of a system architecture.

Both radiological and microscopical image interpretation were considered. The types of investigation which constitute the bulk of the workload in a hospital department were studied, in order to identify potential mainstream applications of computer based methods. In both cases a representative set of images were collected and annotated with a description of the clinically significant features; there formed a basis for considering, critically, the role of image interpretation in current medical practice and for identifying the types of assistance which could be provided by a computer based system.
Those types identified were:
quality control;
prescreening or prompting. In prescreening the system presents to the user only those images which are suspicious. In prompting all images are presented to the user and the locations of potential abnormalities indicated;
intelligent display (eg 3-dimensional structure);
quantitative description;
communication and group working;
staff training and clinical research.

The underlying technology required in each case is very similar and it was therefore decided that the development of a flexible system could be attempted which would cope with any of these forms of support. This required a capability for automated image interpretation and therefore a knowledge based approach was adopted. The main issues of knowledge representation, reasoning and control were addressed by a number of activities, leading to a proposal for a system architecture. The functional requirements were translated into a set of technical requirements, developing a conceptual framework within which system design issues could be addressed.
Many patient management decisions are based on the interpretation of images. The most important examples are macroscopic images, generated in the radiology department, and microscopic images generated in the hospital laboratory. The last few decades have seen the development of new methods of visualization which allow the intricate relationship between structure and function to be explored in ever increasing detail. These provide the basis for better informed clinical decisions but have created a problem in dealing with the quantity and complexity of data. A computer-based system to help the radiologist or microscopist manage the collection and interpretation of image data could improve the clinical effectiveness of image-based decisions and maximize the use of scarce human resources. 
An intelligent computer system could, in principle, provide routine support for the clinician by providing sophisticated display facilities for multi-dimensional or multi-modal data ; objective measurements of structure and function ; prescreebing to select cases or individual features for far more detailed assessment ; comparison with reference images ; advice on protocols for further investigation. Previous attempts to address this problem have succeeded in providing machine assistance for particular image interpretation tasks but generally the systems which have been developed either operate with a great deal of autonomy within a very narrow domain of application or they offer flexibility at the expense of very low-level user interface. This has resulted in a great deal of non-reusable technology which is of limited value. The need is for a general purpose system which is sufficiently intelligent that it can work co-operatively with the clinician without the need for detailed, low-level interaction. 
The project we propose will build on recent advances in knowledge-based image interpretation and IKBS in general. The project team will comprise medical practitioners, academics and industrial researchers who will form a strong multi-disciplinary team. The objective is not at this stage to develop a working system but rather to concentrate on defining functional objectives for such a system, identifying the key medical and technical issues and assessing technical options. The work will be divided into three main phases : 
I. Analysis of requirements 
II. Development of a Design Proposal 
III. Development of a plan for further action. 
The first phase involves an analysis of current practice in radiology and microscopy. A careful consideration of the organization and clinical issues will lead to a proposal for the role of an image-based decision support system and hence to a definition of functional requirements. The design will identify the main structures and processes of the system based, as far as possible, on the integration of existing technology. The final phase will involve defining realistic goals for a pilot system and formulating an action plan. 
Main Deliverables : 
To define functional requirements for image interpretation in radiology and microscropy, knowledge representation requirements. Assessment of reasoning and control methodologies.

- develop concepts and experiences by implementations of CIM support systems in operational environments 
- make available the concepts and experiences gained in this project to European industry by developing a methodology for the introduction of CIM systems.

The partners believe that the methodology of progressing towards an integrated manufacturing environment has largely been neglected, with most of the emphasis being placed on the problems of technology. This project will therefore concentrate on defining this methodology. 

The enterprise functions that are to be integrated have been chosen from different types of industry:

8268;3264;COMPASS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;A Comprehensive Algebraic Approach to System Specification and Development;01/03/1989;29/02/1992;;"An industry of interchangeable and widely marketable software components in Europe is only possible if the functionality of a component can be precisely specified and the implementation (which should remain hidden) can be relied upon to implement this specification correctly. 
The aims of the COMPASS working group were to: 
-provide a comprehensive algebraic approach to the specification of systems and their components 
-provide a formal basis for their correct development 
-consolidate the theoretical background 
-lay the basis for an increased power of support tools 
-encompass new programming methodologies and application areas 
-make progress towards the development of a uniform mathematical framework for logic and semantics within computer science.
The project brought together leading experts in the area of algebraic specification methods in an effort to consolidate and integrate the theoretical basis and apply it to software technology. The algebraic approach treats not only the syntactic aspects of interfaces but also supports the precise specifications of the semantics of generic reusable system components, providing the formal conceptual basis for their stepwise and correct development.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
It is highly desirable to be able to specify only the necessary properties of a component or system in a requirement specification. This is the interface seen by the user that serves as a guideline for the implementor. It should be as precise as necessary, but also as loose as possible, avoiding over-specification of details: thus it leaves freedom for different design decisions by the implementor and is therefore likely to decrease cost and increase efficiency. 
The particular design remains hidden for proprietary reasons; an implementation can be replaced by another one for the same requirement specification. Thus, a high level of abstraction from subsequently introduced design detail can be achieved. The COMPAS S working group studied the possibility of supporting the stepwise development of more detailed versions by semi-automatic tools, which should allow the verification of correctness of each step. The development process itself can be formalised as a basis for a library of generally applicable development methods. 
The flourishing activities in the area of algebraic specification in the past 15 years have led to an abundance of technically different approaches, theories, and concepts. This seeming diversity is only superficial; all approaches share a common framework and mathematical basis. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Algebraic techniques, stimulated by COMPASS members, have already played a dominant role in several national and international research projects, among them various ESPRIT  projects such as DRAGON, FOR-ME-TOO, GRASPIN, LOTOSPHERE, METEOR, PEACOCK, PROSPECTRA, RAISE and SEDOS. 
During the first two years, about 300 research papers have been published by project members (not counting those of associated scientific correspondents). Consolidation of different approaches and extensions into new areas is being attempted in several focal areas, with emphasis so far on the structure of systems (modularisation, re-usability), structure of developments and proofs, and concurrency. 
Other fruitful areas of work include logical foundations, development concepts (methodology, specification languages), environments and tools (prototyping, theorem-proving, term rewriting), and applications. 
Group members have significantly contributed to the development of specification languages and methodologies for development, and also to semi-automatic tools and even complete development environments based on algebraic specifications. For example, the ESPRIT project PROSPECTRA, in which six COMPASS members have been involved; The ASSPEGIQUE system has been used in METEOR; the ACT set of tools is integrated into the systems developed in SEDOS and LOTOSPHERE. 
COMPASS members have initiated a new Working Group 14.3 'Foundations of Systems Specification' of the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP). Its first meeting will be at the next COMPASS/AOT Workshop near Barcelona in October 1992. Members are also actively involved in a German joint project KORSO (Korrekte Software) funded by the BMFT since 1991. 
COMPASS work will be continued in COMPASS II (6112). 
POTENTIAL 
Industry has a growing interest in using formal methods and tools to increase reliability (based on correctness relative to a formal requirements specification) and productivity (through abstraction and reuse). 
Government institutions and private industry are starting to require adherence to formal development methodologies in security and safety-critical areas.

The toolkit will be based on the expansion and integration of current approaches with the aim of producing a unified methodology for enterprise-wide data engineering.

The CODE project aims at supporting enterprise-wide data engineering in all phases. The project covers the creation and customizing of enterprise-wide data models, starting from the creation of generic and partial models and then transforming the partial models into particular, enterprise-specific-models. In addition, the project allows the analysis of the current data structures within a company using a classification and re-engineering approach for the migration from hierarchical or network-oriented databases towards relational databases. 

Furthermore, CODE allows to carry out simulations which rely upon the data stored in the enterprise's databases thus eliminating the necessity of feeding this data manually into the simulation models. 

Usage of the computer-supported CODE methodology may substantially reduce the effort of creating an enterprise-wide data model. Instead of creating the model for every enterprise from scratch, CODE provides the functionality to create the model in a customizing process starting from existing reference models, that are stored in a library. Data engineering is further improved by providing support for the analysis of existing data structures as well as their linkage to the conceptual model. 

The project will produce a new IT product that enhances the functionality of existing tools. The enterprise-wide data model will provide: 

- an information systems design framework including data modelling, classification, re-engineering and simulation 
- data documentation methods 
- a reference model for the harmonization of implemented information systems 
- a common data-migration path 
- a management tool and the basis for developing integrated information systems.

In particular the limitations of traffic responsive systems, and any corresponding requirement for demand management, will be identified.
The main objective of the research was to develop a strategic view of the way in which different approaches to road traffic congestion prevention can be effectively utilised.

The research focused on:
road traffic congestion problems and policies;
congestion prevention techniques;
strategies for combining congestion prevention techniques;
the applicability of congestion prevention alternatives;
results of field trials to predict and prevent congestion on motorways.

The following results have been obtained:
the identification of congestion scenarios has been completed;
interim reports have been prepared on the identification and assessment of congestion strategies;
the technical specification for the field trial on the German motorway network has been completed.
Particular considerations will be: 
- the different types of congestion which can occur and the type of approach which may be appropriate in each case, 
- current policy, experience of and attitudes towards congestion prevention in different countries, 
- the extent to which different strategies or techniques for congestion prevention are complementary or mutually incompatible, 
- the expected timescale and the likelihood of the commercial development of approaches developed within the DRIVE programme. 
Taking these considerations into account, the project will provide a framework identifying the range of applicability of different strategies and techniques for congestion prevention. The comparison of alternatives will be an important feature of this framework, although cost/benefit appraisals will not form part of the project. 
It is important to note that this project is not concerned primarily with the detail of particular strategies or techniques, but with an integrated view of their potential effectiveness in different circumstances and with different policy objectives.

An ELOS will provide transparent access to such services as communications, present an integrated view of applications using a high quality graphical user interface and support the user by means of a computer learning system. The ELOS hardware will be a modular, but closely integrated, system based upon a laptop computer with portable cellular telephone, portable fax and portable peripheral input and output devices such as printers and scanners. This hardware and software combination will provide effective office functionality with a sophisticated communications capability. One major aspect of the project is the provision of adequate support and a high quality interface for the end user. The current plans are for a graphical user interface driven by a pointing device, together with a keyboard for character input.

The elusive office (ELO) project's aim was to develop a highly integrated, portable system that optimizes a worker's mobility, (ie their flexibility with respect to work location and working time). An elusive office system (ELOS) provides transparent access to services such as communications, presentsan integrated view of applications using a high quality graphical user interface, and supports the user by means of a computer learning system. Software is based on state of the art techniques. The prototype ELOS hardware is a modular and functionally integrated system based upon a portable workstation with portable cellular telephone (German C-Net), portable fax, and input/output devices such as printers and scanners.

The ELOS will be demonstrated running on a portable Unix workstation. The functionality to be demonstrated will be fully integrated up to the user interface level and accessible by the user via a high quality graphical user interface operated by a keyboard and a pointing device. The ELO hardware and software demonstrator will offer a system with: integrated generic and specific applications; integrated security services; an integrated computer learning system.
These provide: sophisticated activity planning and communications support; work process support; secure voice, data and fax communication over cellular radio networks; transparent access to services; different types of help systems and learning support to the user.

At present, the prototype ELOS runs on a portable Unix workstation and has a cellular radio phone, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) connection, a fax and data modern linked to it via a communication, a fax and data modem linked to it via a communications concentrator (CC). The CC acts as an intelligent switch controlling the single communications line and the allocation of devices to it. The CC communicates with the Unix workstation via a simple control language.
The ELOS supports a state of the art user interface, devel oped using the C\\ object oriented language and the (public domain) ET\\ toolkit, and uses the X11R4 window system. The prototype ELOS uses the Sun OS4.1 operating system, essentially a Berkeley BSD development.

The aim of the metropolitan area communication system (MAX) project is to provide a solution to the communication needs of heterogeneous business users distributed over large areas with a large concentration of information based organizations. The major objectives were the definition, design, prototype development and testing of a communication system for the flexible provision of basic and enhanced services and the support of multimegabit applications, such as local area network (LAN) to LAN linking, mainframe to mainframe communications, rapid transfer of high resolution images, and audio and video communication and conferencing. MAX is equipped with an advanced management system for configuration, fault management and user environment operation, and will use relevant existing or emerging standards.

Basic architecture and system choices have been made. Optical transmission is based on synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), distributed multiple access protocol on distributed queue dual bus (DQDB), and open systems interconnection (OSI) consistent protocol stacks, and network management systems on telecommunication management network (TMN) principles. Compatibility is maintained with the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and new service standards, such as the connectionless service, whose specifications are under approval. A key element in the MAX architecture is the communication node: all nodes will have the same communication subsystem but can be equipped with different network access modules (NAM) which enable flexible interfacing and interworking with the external world. Specific NAMs will provide access, and a general purpose NAM, bursty data system (BDS), can provide modular communication protocol profiles for other commercial data applications.

The novelty of MAX can be found not only in the specific technical choices for the different subsystem but above all in the overall system features, capable of providing integrated data and video services to meet p otential demand for multiservice business networks.
The major objectives are the definition, design, prototype development and testing of a communication system for the flexible provision of basic and enhanced services and the support of multi-megabit applications, such as LAN-to-LAN linking, mainframe-to-mainframe communications, rapid transfer of high-resolution images, and audio and video communication and conferencing. MAX is equipped with basic management functions for configuration, fault management and user environment operation, and uses relevant existing or emerging standards. 

The output from MAX has been the definition of the overall system and the specification, design and development of its main building blocks, with prototype development being carried out in project 5193, MAXI.";;;;;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA;IT;"COPENHAGEN TELEPHONE COMPANY;Hewlett-Packard Ltd;NKT ELEKTRONIK;L-CUBE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;Alcatel TITN;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);Sirti SpA;Université Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris VI;British Telecom plc (BT)";"DK;UK;EL;FR;IT";

Studies have been made on the production, flux and fate of carbon and nitrogen in coastal marine environments. The main focus was a close examination of the couplings between carbon and nitrogen and the transport across the sediment to water interface. The work included laboratory experiments, field work using large mesocosms and during a cruise. A principal scientific output was the development of new methods to examine carbon and nitrogen fluxes and quantitative descriptions of the flow of energy between various trophic compartments. These analysis include studies of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 used as inorganic and organic tracers and from measurements of their natural abundance, a number of studies using radioactive isotopes and measurements of abundance and activity of viruses. The results were integrated by means of a mathematical dynamic model which contains a description of the structure and function of coastal ecosystems based on mass balances of carbon and nitrogen.
Detailed research will be carried out on the formation, flux and fate of organic matter in the water column and sediments in coastal ecosystems with particular attention to the elements carbon and nitrogen.  The trophic structure of food webs will be studied by means of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes as well as by means of a number of new techniques designed to measure biomass and production of bacteria, phytoplankton, flagellates, ciliates, and mesozooplankton. Particular attention will be paid to the use of flow-cytometry and the role of viruses. The methodological approach of SAFE includes laboratory experiments as well as intensive studies in mesocosms and on open marine stations.  The data are integrated over time and depth to construct a carbon budget of the water column, and combining results from unmanipulated and manipulated mesocosms allows for identification of major factors controlling production and decomposition of organic matter.";;;;CSC;Water Quality Institute;DK;"UNIVERSITY OF WALES - BANGOR;UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN";"UK;NO";
8241;1671;INTEGRATION;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Integration;01/07/1989;31/03/1992;;"This Action aimed at integrating the foundations of functional, logic and object-oriented programming. Some of these combinations have been studied extensively (notably logic and functional programming) while others are much less understood (eg logic and object-oriented programming). A complete integration of the three programming styles is likely to result in a single framework for such disparate issues as higher-order functions and objects, dynamic aspects of object-oriented  programming, declarative semantics in a logic programming style, and possibly  parallelism.
The foundations of functional, logic and object oriented programming are integrated using an approach involving research into semantics, object oriented languages and calculi.

A selection of results include the following:
an efficient technique for implementing the innermost strategy of narrowing coupled with rewriting; significant progress in the study of conditional term rewriting systems, notably with respect to the modular character of fundamental properties such as confluence and termination;
a generalization of the new approach for the semantics of logic programs to a wider class of language such as constraint logic programming;
design of a simple approach for the study of termination of Prolog program (the proposed method allows one to factor termination proofs into simpler, separate proofs and to automate parts of the proof and moreover, the method is modular);
design of a new framework for carrying out semantic approximations of logic programs consisting of a new base interpretation, methods for constructing abstract interpretations starting from the base interpretation and an algorithm to efficiently compute the approximate meanings;
the definition of the language SPOOL-S, incorporating mechanisms for specifying the external behaviour of objects;
definition and implementation of a polymorphic type system incorporating structural inclusion and record inclusion;
design of an indipendent model theoretic semantics for class template programs based on new notions of interpretation, model and logical consequence;
development of procedural, declarative and fixed points semantics for syntactic and semantic forms of inheritance in logic programming (LP);
development of a general paradigm for asynchronous communication (this enables the design of a general semantic framework covering the whole family of parallel LP languages).
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The Action was organised into three work-packages, focusing on the integration of: 
-functional and logic programming 
-functional and object-oriented programming 
-logic and object-oriented programming. 
The tasks undertaken within each work-package (ten in total) were selected so that common problems and techniques could be identified. For example, tasks dealing with semantic issues have been defined, devoted to extending the customary declarative semantics for logic programming to subtyping and to parallelism in logic and object-oriented programming respectively. 
The research in this Action relied strongly on mathematical methods such as term-rewriting systems, automatic theorem-proving, lambda-calculus, equational theory, domain theory and category theory. As a result of the sound use of these mathematical tools,it was hoped to be able to clarify a number of fundamental issues in the areas of programming language design, formal description and methodology. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS AS OF OCTOBER 1991 
The Action produced over 40 papers during its second year. A selection of results includes: 
-An efficient technique for implementing the inner-most strategy of narrowing coupled with rewriting was elaborated. 
-Significant progress was made in the study of Conditional Term Rewriting Systems, notably with respect to the modular character of fundamental properties such as confluence and termination. 
-A generalisation was obtained of the new approach for the semantics of logic programs to a wider class of language such as Constraint Logic Programming. 
-A simple approach was designed for the study of termination of Prolog programs. The proposed method allows one to factor termination proofs into simpler, separate proofs and to automate parts of the proof. Moreover, the method is modular.

COMPARE aims to produce a complete compilation system based on the COSY model. Through an emphasis on compiler generation tools, this system is intended to be applicable to new processor and architecture designs as they become available, and to be adaptable to new compiler technology as it is developed.
Compilers for modern, high performance architectures are still mainly handcrafted, without the benefit of well specified theory and technology. It is not yet known how best to compile to architectures such as VLIW and distributed systems or the more ambitious highly parallel architectures. Even for architectures which are relatively well understood, such as reduced instruction set computers (RISC) and vector machines, compilers are still built by hand at high cost.
The project proposed to extend the basic compilation technology for those architectures that are not yet well understood, and to extend the technology in compiler generation tools for those architectures that are better understood.
A new compiler construction technology has been developed resulting in the ACE EXPERT compilers for the SPARC architecture. These compilers combine the industry proven EXPERT frontends for ANSI-C, K&R-C, Fortran 77, Pascal and Modula-2, with a fully computer generated SPARC code generator. The EXPERT SPARC code generator has been generated automatically from a concise architecture description. With this generator technology, code generators for today's increasingly parallel architectures can be produced more efficiently. The compilers have undergone extensive field testing and the robustness resulting from the use of generators was proven using large industrial programs. Program modules written in different languages can be mixed by simply linking them together.
COMPARE will produce a compiler construction system that allows the efficient production of competitive commercial compiler products. This system is intended to be incorporated in products in order to keep Europe at the leading edge in the areas of formal language and compiler research. 

Based on the results of the prototyping effort CLaX (Compare Language Example), the design of the COSY model has been completed. Implementation of the model is in full progress and the associated tools are stabilising. 

The first full-fledged compilers, integrated in COSY, will be demonstrated at the beginning of the last year of the project. This last year will concentrate on the exploitation of the optimisation potential enabled by the COSY model.";;;;;ASSOCIATED COMPUTER EXPERTS;NL;"SAARLAND UNIVERSITY;STICHTING VOOR MATEMATISCH CENTRUM - CENTRUM VOOR WISKUNDE & INFORMATICA;Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;Steria;Harlequin Ltd";"DE;NL;FR;UK";

Efficient algorithms are crucial for the effective performance of any information processing system. ALCOM aims to establish a network of researchers cooperating in the field of algorithm design and analysis, and to carry out research in several key areas of computational complexity theory. The goal of the Action was to strengthen and advance  fundamental research in the design of analysis of computer algorithmsin the European Community. 
The primary goal of ALCOM was to obtain good algorithms and data structures for practical use, and to assess their complexity by discrete mathematical or analytic techniques. The secondary goal was to understand the inherent complexity of problems and methods so that questions of optimality (or near-optimality) can be considered.
A network of researchers cooperating in the field of algorithm design and analysis has been establihed. Coordinated research took place in the following areas:
 data structures (new techniques for maintaining sets of geometric objects for efficient query answering, algorithms for computing obstacle free shortest paths, advances in persistent datastructures, on line algorithms for maintaining components in dynamic graphs, and a new release of the algorithms library LEDA);
computational geometry (new algorithms for computing Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations, output sensitive algorithms for hidden surface removal for polytopes, advances in scene analysis, and randomized incremental constructions);

APPROACH AND METHODS 
Research in ALCOM focused on the development of general  tools and techniques that can be employed in a wide variety of computer applications. Efficient algorithms and data structures were developed for selected problems in a number of key areas (eg computational geometry, graphs and networks, and combinatorial optimisation), and their complexity assessed by discrete mathematical, analytic and  experimental techniques. 
Probabilistic methods were also explored to analyse the performance of algorithms and to design algorithms with good expected runtimes. The research extends to fundamental problems in parallel computing and distributed processing, and addresses suitable models of processor or computer interconnection networks and communication protocols, with due attention to invariant-based design methods. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS AS OF OCTOBER 1991

The work continues in project 7364.
The goal of this project was to provide a standardised framework for computer aided design (CAD) tools to serve as a general, common software infrastructure for efficiently building, maintaining and configuring open integrated CAD environments.

Specific goals were to:
evaluate existing frameworks and framework components;
specify framework requirements for future frameworks;
define a common JESSI framework architecture;
define the first working interfaces;
develop a first JESSI framework prototype.
The specification of framework requirements occurred in close contact with international standardisation efforts.

The respective benefits of the different framework approaches were thoroughly evaluated and compared. The result of this activity was a report on benefits and shortcomings as well as a collection of requirements form the users' point of view. Small prototype environments, built on top of the existing framework components, were delivered as demonstrators.

Working interfaces were established between the SIGMA and the NMP-CADLAB approaches in order to achieve a further unification of European framework development and to set up a common SIGMA-NMP-CADLAB framework. As a result, a first JESSI common framework prototype was produced, which met many of the relevant requirements.
The operating environment is as follows :
(CAD) and design methodologies
The goals of the JESSI framework are to: 

- provide a software platform for the integration of CAD tools and for the derivation of integrated, highly productive CAD environments, which will greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of chip and system design work 
- offer an extensive set of services in order to maximise programming and design efficiency on the tool and environment level 
- provide basic interfaces that are easily accessible and standardised in order to ease tool porting and exchange between environments. 

The JESSI framework is now available in terms of: 

- a common logical JESSI framework model, with commonly agreed basic interfaces 
- a complete software implementation. 

As far as efficiency is concerned, it is expected that the effort for tool integration, which presently amounts to person-months or years (even for relatively loose coupling), will be cut back to a few person-weeks, -days or even -hours depending on the tool characteristics and the level of automation achieved in the course of framework development. Similar reductions can be expected for the building and configuration of new tools or application environments, depending on the quality and scope of the tool-building and configuration facilities offered by the framework. 

The JCF project provides the JESSI framework to all JESSI CAD projects as a series of consecutive, stepwise-enhanced releases, which will offer a growing set of services and continuous increase of performance and efficiency. The project will also offer support to safeguard the effective use of the JESSI framework. Moreover, the JESSI framework will be made available to ESPRIT projects and external users (under conditions to be specified). 

The project is divided into start-up, main and completion phases. Project 5082 was the start-up phase The objectives of this phase (mid-1990 to mid-1991) were to: 

- ensure the European advantage in framework technology 
- start, as quickly as possible, on the development of the JESSI framework 
- prepare for the main phase of the project. 

Specific goals were to: 

- evaluate existing frameworks and framework components 
- specify framework requirements for future frameworks

It was investigated if the material can deliver both optoelectronic receivers and transmitters and what limitations these have.
New materials that make possible the integration of light emitting diodes (LED) and photodiodes with conventional integrated circuit (IC) technology were synthesized. These new optoelectronic materials consist of silicon/germanium strained layer superlattices (SLS), and are produced using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The properties of these heterostructures were predicted with theoretical models and measured using extensive characterization techniques.

Ultrathin layer silicon germanium SLS have been grown on silicon substrates and several SLS structures have been analyzed by cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) where the structural parameters as well as the growth quality in terms of interface sharpness, morphology and defect characterization was assessed. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, strong signals have been found for 10 monolayer SLSs in the near infrared region (0.8 eV). By etching away the SLS it was clearly proved that the PL signal come from the superlattice.
Computer codes for calculating the electronic band structure and related properties as a function of period length and composition have been developed. The band gap and oscillator strengths for a number of different structures have been calculated. The oscillator strength and the spectral form of the quasi direct optical transitions for ideal infinite SLS structures as well as for non ideal finite structures have been calculated.
The photoreflectance technique was successfully tested for analysis of optical transitions and the growth quality of theSLS was drastically improved by using a predeposited antimony adlayer as surfactant during growth.
Finally by applying standard semiconductor processing techniques mesa and waveguide (ridge) diodes were fabricated.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
-Ultra-thin SimGen superlattices are synthesised on silicon substrates by molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth at low temperatures (300-400 C). Strain adjustment by a thin Si1-yGey alloy buffer layer is used to obtain device meaningful thicknesses (0.25 micron) of the subsequent superlattice layer. 
-The superlattice structure is then characterised by methods including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Rutherford back-scattering (RBS). The structural properties of the SLS are its periodicity (the total of n\m monol ayers), composition (the specific values of n and m), and strain distribution. Raman spectroscopy performed on the ultrathin SimGen superlattices reveals information on the built-in strain, interface sharpness, composition and period of the SLS. 
-Theoretical models are developed that predict the optical and electrical properties of the SLS. Calculations of the electronic bandstructure and related properties of the superlattice as a function of its composition will be performed, and the results u sed to synthesise superlattices with optimum performance for optical device applications. 
-Simple optoelectronic receiver and transmitter type devices will be built to probe material quality for possible industrial applications and exploitation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Ultrathin layer SimGen SLS have been grown on silicon substrates with periods including 2 (Si1Ge1), 8 (Si4Ge4), 10 (Si6Ge4,Si5Ge5), 20 and 40 monolayers 
-Several SLS structures have been analysed by cross-sectional TEM and XRD where the structural parameters as well as the growth quality in terms of interface sharpness, morphology and defect characterisation was assessed. Selected area diffraction in the TEM analysis reveals complementary information to the X-ray diffraction. 
-In the photoluminescence spectrum, strong signals have been found for 10 monolayer SLS's in the near-infrared region (0.8 eV). By etching away the SLS it was clearly proved that the PL signals come from the superlattice. 
-Computer codes for calculating the electronic bandstructure and related properties as a function of period length and composition have been developed. The band-gap and oscillator strengths for a number of different structures have been calculated. Optim um oscillator strength is predicted for a symmetrical 10 monolayer superlattice, Si5Ge5. By tuning the strain distribution through varying the buffer layer, the bandstructure and oscillator strength values have been calculated. 
-The oscillator strength and the spectral form of the quasi-direct optical transitions for ideal infinite SLS structures as well as for non-ideal finite structures have been calculated. A quantitative and qualitative assessment of the finite structures h as been made and compared with experimental data. 
-The photoreflectance technique was successfully tested for analysis of optical transitions. Rather strong signals at 2.2 eV < hw < 2.4 eV have been seen in a Si5Ge5 superlattice. 
-The growth quality of the SLS, i.e interface sharpness and planarity, was drastically improved by using a predeposited Sb adlayer as surfactant during growth. By applying techniques like spontaneous incorporation from a predeposited adlayer (Sb), coevap oration from an elemental effusion cell (B) and doping by secondary implantation (DSI;Sb) we have successfully achieved growth of p-n doped diodes with abrupt transitions, a prerequisite for the fabrication of diodes. 
-By applying standard semiconductor processing techniques mesa and waveguide (ridge) diodes were fabricated. Electroluminescence (EL) as well as photoluminescence (PL) in the near infrared regime has been observed from these diodes up to temperatures ofT=160K - the first reported observation of EL from Si/GeSLS diodes at elevated temperatures. 
POTENTIAL 
Tailoring the optical properties of the SimGen SLS will have a dramatic impact on today's silicon-based optoelectronics, because it makes possible the integration of opto-electronic devices such as LEDs or photodiodes with the highly complex and mature silicon IC technology. The main result of this Action is the ability to grow SimGen superlattice semiconductors with periodic arrangement of atomic monolayers with sufficient quality for future device applications. In addition, a quantitative theoretical understanding of the optical and electrical properties of the simple SimGenSLS should be achieved which serves as model system for other mismatched heterostructure and superlattice systems. The methods and techniques acquired can be exploited in other systems too.";;;;;Daimler-Benz AG;DE;"UNIVERSITY OF LUND;UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;Technische Universität München";"SE;UK;DE";

For management reasons, it was divided in three sub-packages, dealing with dopant diffusion, thermal oxidation and topography, and ion implantation. The second work-package addressed optimisation techniques for device design with the aim of setting up an automatic optimisation tool, the third covered software integration and global validation on industrial applications.

The project takes into account the need to interwork with the following environments: ESPRIT CNMA, MAP, TOP, and ISDN.
The diffuse infrared emitting strategy and its advantage for indoor telecommunications is presented. The technological choices for the infrared channel are based upon 3 points: The integrated services digital network (ISDN) compatibility; The user requirements and the available infrared components. The corresponding electrical architecture for Infrared emitters and receivers is presented with its implementation for prototypes, with the first results of the prototype implementation and the total performances that can be expected from the diffuse infrared transmission channel. The feasibility of diffuse infrared transmission has been validated and the first measurments are in good agreement with theoretical results. The main problem is still the electrical consumption of the emitter. Further investigations are necessary in order to select more efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) with shorter emitted pulses. In particular, special care must be taken in the cooling of LED devices to prevent thermal decrease of the efficiency. Laser diodes could be an alternative. They permit very short pulses and also a very selective optical filtering of ambient light. The main problem is the cost.

The objective of this project is to define, specify, develop and demonstrate a multiservice communication system (data, voice and image) based on mobile infrared terminals for indoor industrial applications suitable for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) factories and broadsite plants. The system particularly addresses the need for mobility and for reliable communications in the presence of severe electromagnetic interference, as encountered in electrical power plants, substations and other factories. It provides wireless infrared communication inside limited size cells, together with a backbone network linking all subsystems. Low cost limit feature terminals as well as high performance, multiservice mobile terminals have been specified.
The project started with an assessment of users' requirements for large plants as well as small and medium enterprises. The results are grouped into requirements for the network, terminals, and gateways and environmental conditions. In addition, a state of the art survey indicates the main problem areas in terms of technologies and techniques. Based on these results, a communication system has been defined that includes asynchronous and synchronous data streams as well as isochronous ones. Integrated services digital network (ISDN) is chosen as the basis for the systemarchitecture. The protocols used fit as closely as possible to those of ISDN, and corresponding services can be implemented. The main aspects of the project are the infrared technology and the communication system. 2 types of terminals have been developed: a mobile ISDN voice terminal, and an ISDN-VME-board to connect terminals to the factory customer premises (FCP) network.
In a pilot site demonstrator a mobile vision robot and also the host system in the control room are equipped with one ISDN-VME-board to establish a wireless link between them by means of diffused infrared light. In addition, voice communication between a phone connected to the host system v ia the ISDN-VME-board and a mobile ISDN voice terminal can be done.

The specification of these devices will be aligned with IBC network requirements, especially the need to support multi-gigabit systems ( 10 Gbit/s). 
The objective of the research was to develop highly advanced quantum well based, semiconductor lasers and modulators with enhanced performance. The specification of these devices has to conform with integrated broadband communications (IBC) network requirements, especially the need to support multigigabit systems (10 gigabet per second).
The key issues comprised of material and device characteristics to produce devices for high speed modulation with high power output, low chirp and high efficiency.

The research resulted in the following achievements:
through investigations of growth techniques were carried out with rapid feedback provided via modelling and sophisticated measurement techniques with atomic monolayer resolution;
a major effort was directed to the realization of advanced device structures (these has been successfully tested in 10 gigabytes per second systems);
threshold current densities as low as 260 amperes per square centimetre in strained gallium indium arsenic phosphide multiple quantum well (MQW) lasers have been obtained;
key optoelectronic components were developed and realized;
quantum well (QW) modulators based on the quantum confirmed stark effect (QCSE) and Warnier stark effect (WSE) were successfully realized in both material systems (ie gallium indium arsenic phosphide/indium phosphide and gallium indium aluminium arsenide/indium phosphide).
Technical Approach  

Based on highly advanced, potentially low cost epitaxial technologies, such as MBE/GSMBE/MOMBE and AP/LP MOVPE, both the InGaAsP/InP and InGaAlAs/InP material systems will be exploited in terms of all parameters relevant to QW based lasers and modulators.  

Extremely low parasitic laser structures will be realised to reveal the expected device performance increase by QW effects (low temperature sensitivity, high efficiency, high modulation bandwidth, low chirp for QW lasers and high modulation efficiency, extended modulation bandwidth, drastically reduced chirp for QW modulators).  This will require a profound understanding of material and device parameters, together with sophisticated characterisation techniques; to give a continuous feedback process towards overall optimisation of devices for system applications.  

Key Issues  
The key issues for this project comprise control of material and device characteristics so as to produce devices for high speed modulation, high power output with low chirp and high efficiency.  This is expected to enhance system structures and performance.  

Achievements  
Thorough investigations of growth techniques were continued, with rapid feedback provided via modelling and sophisticated measurement techniques with atomic mono-layer resolution.  A major effort was directed to the realisation of advanced device structures - these have been successfully tested in 10 Gbit/s systems.  

The work has resulted in 51 papers and publications in the past year.  Among the best results, world-wide threshold current densities as low as 260A/cm2 in strained GaInAsP MQW lasers have been obtained.  

High speed laser structures have reached a mature state thus allowing to take full benefit of QW technology. Nevertheless, new structures with extremely reduced parasitics were developed, exhibiting capacitances in the sub pF range (VUG) and further pushing-up the bandwidth limitation due to parasitic effects.  

During 1991, selected strained and unstrained MQW DFB SI BH lasers were delivered to R1051 for system tests. All QW lasers showed excellent results at 10 Gbit/s, bringing Europe to the forefront of the world stage. The AQUA project was represented at the RACE stand on the exhibition during ECOC/IOOC'91 in Paris, with a common demonstration by R1051 and R1057 entitled 8.96 Gbit/s Distribution of 64 (HD)TV Channels to 260 Thousand Subscribers using Novel MQW DFB Laser and Optical Amplifiers.  Key opto-electronic components for this were developed and realised within AQUA.  

QW modulators based on the QCSE and WSE were successfully realised in both material systems, GaInAsP/InP and GaInAlAs/InP.  Rapid progress was enabled by the expertise in QW technology gained within the project, leading to convincing results like high extinction rations over 20dB, low modulation voltages, high bandwidths exceeding 10GHz and initial yet-to-be- optimised devices operating at 5 Gbit/s.  

Expected Impact  
It is expected that the way towards high speed systems of improved performances will be considerably eased by the availability of QW lasers and modulators.  This enhancement of performance will have a market impact on systems allowing for higher data rates and reduced component costs.";;;;;Alcatel SEL AG;DE;"UNIVERSITAET STUTTGART;France Telecom;EFPL;PHILIPPS UNIVERSITAET MARBURG;Thomson CSF;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA;Alcatel Alsthom Recherche";"DE;FR;CH;IT";

Object-oriented systems of the type envisaged incorporate a wide range of features (such as data encapsulation, data abstraction and inheritance) which guarantee a high application quality and ensure reusability on a large scale. In addition to the advantages to be gained from this approach, the use of existing and foreseeable standards will play a decisive role, offering numerous benefits for all parties involved in the application development process.

The underlying objective is to create a platform that will enable a wide range of applications to be developed quickly, reliably and at low cost. This approach is reflected to some degree in a number of developments today, but as a result of its innovative nature and the leading-edge methods involved has yet to gain a firm foothold in the market. 

The system will consists of the following components: 

- object-oriented kernel 
- evolving object-oriented software base 
- applications development environment 
- applications support environment. 

The object-oriented kernel will incorporate the programming language, the compiler, run-time support features for the objects, and the integrated database support facility. The software base will be geared specifically to the respective applications and will be upgraded as new applications are perfected. It will incorporate a generic office model for reuse by other applications and will be based on an integrated and distributed multimedia environment. 

The applications development environment will consist of a set of tools aimed at aiding the application programmer in specifying requirements and in modelling the application under development. Particular consideration will be given to providing support for an object-oriented life-cycle geared towards streamlining the configuration process called for by the applications. In addition, the application development tools will provide assistance when designing the objects specified by the respective applications and when selecting pertinent objects from the current software base; they will support the development of any new objects required, and will prove helpful in the individual configuration phases. The application support environment will provide application users with an advanced user interface, an activity coordination facility, and a management system. 

Two procedures will be employed to validate the environment. Firstly, a bootstrap technique will be used to develop the entire system in a single unique language, with the aim of proving that the environment is suitable for system programming. Secondly, several applications will be developed to illustrate the usefulness of the environment for the applications development. 

Unlike other developments on the market, ITHACA is not aimed at creating niche applications geared wholly for use in dedicated environments. Rather, the focus is on achieving a high level of openness on an object-oriented level with the aim of providing comprehensive support for object-oriented software development methods. 

The partners involved in the project are established, competent and experienced computer manufacturers, software houses, users and reputable academic institutions. As founding members of the Open Software Foundation (OSF), Nixdorf and Bull foresee a high level of integration of the project results into the activities of this organisation, thus guaranteeing that standards - a vital concept in view of the demand for openness and reusability in the field of information technology as a whole - are laid down and implemented to the greatest possible extent.

evaluation of the usability of the system.

The research has achieved the following results:
 a survey of technologies to be used;

the identification of application domains and system architecture;
setting up a test and development platform;
a system design incorporating conferencing and message handling, manufacturers manuals, multimedia databases, logical security, transmux control, connection handling, still pictures, video archives, system integration and user tests.
Technical Approach  

The system will be based on interactive communications, allowing a group of two or more partners to be in simultaneous session with each other (a conferencing system).  Integrated services will be defined employed, and evaluated in a number of business application areas with different communication needs.  Information sources and destinations to be supported by the pilot include:  

. databases containing documents consisting of text, structured data, graphics and images  
. video libraries  
. advanced mobile and stationary graphic workstations for display and processing of technical documents, still pictures and videos and with interfaces to video cameras and receivers, picture digitisers, special transducers, etc.  

The system will have the ability to connect to a number of private corporate information systems, since part of the information to be exchanged in the application pilot will only be accessible from such sources. Privacy of the communication should be ensured: authentication control, encryption of information and other security issues are considered mandatory.  

The RESAM project was divided into four phases.  Phase I concentrating on user requirements, forming the basis for developing the RESAM pilot system design.  Phase II focuses on defining and establishing the RESAM pilot system design, followed by Phase III on provisioning, implementation and testing of the pilot.  Phase IV covers the evaluation and reporting of results and conclusions.

Revealing and exploring phenomena which might be exploitable in future semiconductor devices was the main focus of the work. Fabrication technologies for structures with critical dimensions down to 10 nm were to be developed and the process-related issues studied.
Semiconductor structures and devices with critical feature sizes down to 10 nm (so called nanostructures) were studied. Knowledge of the properties of nanostructures is important both to understand the behaviour of conventional electronic devices at the limits of miniaturization and to invent new classes of devices. Technologies suited to the fabrication of nanostructures, including electron beam nanolithography, dry etching and molecular beam epitaxial growth, were optimized for this purpose.

Research has been carried out in the following areas:
quantum transport (progess has been made in understanding the properties of electronic transport in ultrasmall quantum dots defined by 2 or more point contacts);
periodic structures (understanding of the static and dynamic properties of electrons confined in lateral superlattice potentials of various geometry and strength has vastly increased);
overgrowth (this topic was expanded to include not only the overgrowth of laterally patterned quantum well material to reduce the effects of the air semiconductor interface, but also the direct growth of nanostructures using the inherent mechanisms of the growth process itself);
optics (luminescence studies of overgrown quantum dots showed not only the increase in luminescence efficiency but also significant red shifting and broadening of the emission peak and to further explore the role of defects in determining luminescence efficiency, the transition between wire- behaviour and dot- behaviour was studied and showed that the luminescence from a wire increases as the wire is shortened);
growth (having shown that gallium arsenic can be growth with sufficiently high purity and quality to obtain peak mobilities of 4E5 cm{2}/Vs rather than the more common arsenic(4) this material was incorporated into 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) layers and with further attention to sources of impurities in the growth machine, it has been shown that full wafers of 2DEG material having mobili ty approximately 3E6 cm{2}/Vs can be consistently grown).
POTENTIAL 
The miniaturisation of conventional electronic devices could be inhibited for a variety of reasons, including fundamental limitations to device operation and difficulties in fabrication. At the same time, the new physics revealed in ultra-small semiconductor structures may be exploitable.

A reference model as a general approach for deriving specific software development strategies has been constructed. A flexible, adaptable architecture has been used, open for the integration of future software components. The integrated product model contains all information about the product and its production processes.

The main functional improvements have been to combine solid and surface techniques for all planning stages to offer practice oriented unfolding techniques for 3-dimensional models and to combine generic and knowledge based process planning to offer full automated numerical control (NC) part programming.

By simulation and evaluation, the capabilities of machining have been used to optimize the product. Know how gained is made available as feedback information by knowledge based modules cooperating with the product and production process model. The economic objectives are to become more competitive on time and to cut costs by increasing quality and productivity.

Results have been demonstrated in the application areas of sheet metal parts manufacturing for aircraft spares and complex shape parts manufacturing for ship propellers.

Each action, whether performed by man or machine, is a combination of objects and information. Which items of information and how many of them are needed depends on the smoothness with which this communication process takes place. Information should not have to be requested or searched for, but should active and make itself available. This has been achieved by integration on the application level. The use of features supports integration on a semantical level. This facilitates communication between business activities.
The two main goals are to improve the efficiency of software vendors by making software easier to integrate, and to improve the user's efficiency by enhancing the functionality of existing CIM modules. 

Current limitations of integration, caused by the use of specific data representations for different CIM modules, will be overcome by a conceptual approach using features in all stages of the manufacturing process of a product. 

IMPPACT aims to improve the understanding of the integration of successive production phases by recognising that the information system needs feedback loops. 

The reference model to be specified serves as a general approach for deriving specific software development strategies for different application areas. It helps build the framework and ensures a reduction in the gap between the user's requirements and the software developed. 

A flexible, adaptable architecture will be used, capable of handling software packages with individual structures and environments while running on different hardware. The architecture is open for the integration of future software. The integrated product model will contain all necessary information about standards and processes. 

The main functional improvements will be to: 

- combine solid and surface techniques and make these available at the process planning stage

Indicators of effectiveness as well as quality of care are needed. In order to reach this objective information needs standardization. 
The present project is aimed at designing a uniform model of reference for medical data including severity of cases as well as for resources and costs data related to hospital inpatients stays and at testing this model by hospital comparisons between countries. In order to compare case-mix, groupers (DRG, PMC, ...) have to be used. 
A European approach towards resource management and strategic planning has been defined by specifying information standards needed across countries, as well as a methodology to measure resources and costs at institutional and inter institutional levels. A European Health Data Base (EHDB) was set up in order to test data availability and comparability as well as to validate models through macro comparisons using case mix, diagnosis related group (DRG) refined grouping, disease staging and microcomparions based on 3 diseases (cardiac valve replacement, diabetes mellitus and hip fracture). Presently this EHDB contains 274 164 medical record summaries sampled from 7 countries. This allowed the building of prototypes using Clipper, Prolog and SQL in order to compare uniform aggregates for different countries, with standard software tools for statistical comparisons. It showed the present feasibility to use case mix based on the European Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) and the difficulty in obtaining uniform data on resources and costs, other than length of stay, across countries. Medical data confidentiality was assured but not yet population based representatively. A number of problems have been identified, given the current state of development of the EHDB, which can be solved by international research and development projects in the near future. A review of methods used by the partners to test exhaustivity, reliability and accuracy of medical data in the MBDS was made and proposed to European countries. Available case mix grouping systems were tested within and between countries, using available MBDS as well as the existing experience with DRG utilization in diverse regions in Europe. A large number of results were obtained relating to length of stay and use of resources. The research concludes that hospitals from various European countries might learn a lot from each other if they agree to use uniform data sets and models.
The starting point is the determination of the uses and users (physicians, department hospital, public health authority, ...) and the inventory and assessment of the model existing in this field and outside Europe. 
Theoretical model of reference will be proposed and model of reference for the next year will be elaborated based on the available data. This last model will be tested on the data provided by the different countries in order to validate the model and to identify commonalties and differences between hospitals and between countries. 
Jointly a coherent strategy for the development and implementation of suitable standards and architectures that support the comparison of hospitals through combination of medical and financial data.

8672;2071;COMANDOS-2;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Construction and Management of Distributed Open Systems;01/03/1989;28/02/1993;;"The development of application software is currently a labour- and cost-intensive task, especially for distributed applications. The overall objective of COMANDOS has been to help facilitate the construction of large-scale, multivendor, distributed open systems by providing an integrated applications support environment for programming and using distributed applications that can manipulate long-lived data. The COMANDOS project was targeted at loosely coupled distributed systems of workstations, servers and processor pools, using internets based primarily on LANs.
This result describes the security functions supported by the COMANDOS kernels. These functions are grouped in sets, and each of them is identified through an index, the security level. The security level is a number that reflects the set of security services to be used on a COMANDOS system, and the quality of service to be provided by each of them on each invocation. This work states the security services selectable by a COMANDOS security administrator, and its logical combinations to be supported by the system in the project framework. The specific procedures to be used for each security service, at each level, are installation dependent, and must be agreed over the whole domain.

The Comandos project is designing and implementing a platform to support distributed persistent applications. The platform supports the object oriented style of programming. An essential requirement of the Comandos platform is that it must support applications written in a variety of existing, as well as new (object oriented), programming languages. Moreover, the platform must support interworking between different languages. Each language may naturally have its own object model and execution structures implemented by a language specific runtime system. Comandos provides a generic runtime system on top of which individual language's specific runtimes may be implemented in order to exploit the distribution and persistence support provided by the Comandos platform rather than forcing each language to adopt a common object model and execution structures. In this paper we show how a language specific runtime for an existing language such as C\\ can be constructed above the Comandos generic runtime.

The overall objective of the project is to help facilitate the construction of large scale, multivendor, distributed open systems by providing an integrated applications support environment for programming and using distributed applications that can manipulate long lived data. The project is targeted at loosely coupled distributed systems of workstations, servers and processor pools, using internets based primarily on local area networks (LAN).
To construct such a platform requires the integration of 3 key aspects: operating systems, data management and programming languages. An object oriented approach for the operating system support has been adopted, which can be exploited by data management systems and integrated with programming language environments. Intrinsic components of the platform are administrative tools to manage the operation of an installed system, and user interface generation tools to aid the development of interactive applications.

This project builds on a previous project which was mainly dedicated to the exploratory prototyping of the platform. A number of significant achievements were demonstrated in project 834 (COMANDOS-1), and based on these results a further consolidation and integration phase has allowed the development of an integrated prototype of the platform (Release-1). A full preindustrial prototype of the platform (Release-2) has been provided. In parallel, Release-1 is being used as an experimental basis for the construction of extended facilities (mainly a distributed directory service and online management facilities) and for the development of a real world application in the office area. Consolidation and enhancement of the preindustrial prototype will be carried out, including the integration of various facilities already developed on top of Release-1.

The Cidre office system is an enhanced groupware application based on structured documents, which can be used within or between corelated companies to support cooperative work.

The Cidre administrator defines and registers office procedures by specifying models of documents, folders and the associated circulation schemes. Each user can initialize an office procedure, which involves a given circulation scheme. The documents are automatically circulated, following the scheme and taking into account the presence of absence of users involved in the circulation, with delegation facilities. Users may inquire about the state of a given folder from the system. Additional services are provided, such as:
opening a talk session between several users to negotiate about a particular folder;
searching for information about the company organization.

The use of the underlying Comandos distributed platform allows Cidre to combine advantages of both a networked workstation approach and a centralized approach:
each workstation can operate autonomously on its own data;
alternatively the integrated approach allows each user to have a global view of the distributed office system.

Cidre was designed using the Comandos object oriented model. It was implemented on a Unix based version of the platform using the Comandos object oriented language. In addition Cidre uses further facilities of the Comandos platform, such as persistency, object migration, and ability to reuse Unix applications and other Comandos applications.
To construct such a platform requires the integration of three key aspects: operating systems, data management and programming languages. An object-oriented approach for the operating system support has been adopted, which can be exploited by data management systems and integrated with programming language environments. Intrinsic components of the platform are administrative tools to manage the operation of an installed system, and user-interface generation tools to aid the development of interactive applications.";;;;;BULL SA;FR;"Applied Research Group SpA;Service d'Études Communes de la Poste et de France Télécom;Siemens AG;Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA;University of Dublin;Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;Universitaet Stuttgart;Chorus Systèmes SA;Open Software Foundation Research Institute;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG)";"IT;FR;DE;ES;IE;PT;UK";

These areas have shown urgent needs for a total solution particularly oriented to cost savings in system installation and maintenance and capable of ensuring the straightforward interworking of heterogeneous user subsystems.
A user interface and protocols which link message directories informing to X 400 requirements are available.
The operating environment is as follows :
MS-DOS;\UNIX;\Macintosh
The key objectives of IACIS were the definition, design, development and testing, both in the laboratory and in the real environment, of a system capable of solving the problems of this emerging field of information technology application. The innovative solutions proposed in the project 169, LION (Local Integrated Optical Network) were considered and upgraded. The goal of developing demonstrators representative of real user requirements dictated a need to select very complex environments, such as seaport areas (ie Genova, Barcelona, Le Havre and Lisboa) and large events (ie the Olympic Games), as these complex domains will facilitate the assessment of the system as a whole. 

International standards were adopted, such as ISO/OSI for data communication protocols, CCITT for signalling protocols, IEEE for management protocols, X.400 for Message Handling System (MHS), and Office Document Architecture (ODA) and Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) for document architecture and message exchange. 

Integrated service LANs (ISLNs) represent the newest generation of local area networks for attaining service integration in the enterprise of the future. In this field the state of the art is represented by laboratory prototypes of fibre-optic distributed networks working at speeds of around 100 Mbit/s (eg LION, Metrocore). These systems are capable of supporting a wide range of information services (message-handling systems, file transfer, electronic data interchange, network management, database tools, etc), at present in a standardisation or experimentation phase, and are required by applications aimed at large organisations.";;;;;CIA TELEPHONICA NATIONAL;ES;"SYNERGIE INFORMATIQUE & DEVELOPPEMENT;Sistemi e Telematica Porto di Genova SpA;LGMI;Prisma Informatica SpA;Bull Italia SpA;OSITEL;SECRE/SOCIETE D'ETUDES ET RECHERCHES;SERVICIOS DE GESTION TECNOLOGICA;Sirti SpA;Synergia SpA;Televas;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;ERITEL;TECNO T & G;Bull SA;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA;CPV-Stollmann Vertiebs GmbH;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID";"FR;IT;ES;PT;DE";

EMBnet was established in 1988, initially, as a data collection backbone to EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). Thanks to the improvement of computer network communications, its scope and mandate has greatly enlarged and national EMBnet nodes have been entrusted to manage biocomputing services in their own countries. 
A scheme for the future training programme for EMBnet/BRIDGE was decided. This programme included; one ad hoc seminar per annum, practial courses and annual business meetings. For all courses and seminars, precedence has been given to those organised by more than one country.

A pilot project for the development of improved data exchange mechanisms has been started. The acquisition of Multinet TCP/IP software was financed. This software allows the improvement of local communication standard as it is no obstacle for a mixed environment VMS-UNIX, which are the two operative systems most wide spread in the EMBnet community.

A bulletin board was set up for the exchange of experience among the EMBnet users, which can discuss topics of common interest directly online using a single electronic mail address.

A comprehensive study was carried out on the EMBnet status and its possible developments. It listed the various services available online from EMBnet, with a detailed analysis of the connectivity performance. The study also included suggestions for improvement and a chapter was devoted to hardware, users, funding and staff and another to education, user services and databases.
The aim of the proposal is to reinforce the first European Bioinformatic Infrastructure: EMBnet. Embnet is a computer network for the molecular biology and biotechnology community in Europe whose detailed goals are: - the development of a communications infrastructure 
- the involvement of the scientific community in the creation of an information system giving users access to research data 
- the support of biocomputing research and the provision of information services to both academic and industrial users. 
8 EC members (Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom), 4 EFTA members (Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Finland) and 4 industrial groups participate in this project. Furthermore 2 industrial partners (Hoffman Laroche and DEC Italy) have expressed their intent to support the Embnet project as the enclosed letters testify. The proposals we are coordinating are intended to render the Embnet regional nodes fully operative, to catalyze collaboration and to promote new initiatives within the biocomputing field in projects which embrace service, technological and scientific development areas. This project will lead to the enlargement of the European nucleic acid sequences databank which will be especially beneficial in the light of the increasing signs of protectionism in the USA concerning access to US-based data services by non-Americans.";;;;CSC;EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY;DE;"Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen;The Biotechnology Centre of Oslo;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR);GERMAN CANCER RESEARCH CENTER;ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL;FOUNDATION OF RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY - HELLAS;INMUNOLOGIA Y GENETICA APLICADA SA;UNIVERSITY OF AARHUS;UNIVERSITAET BASEL;UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI;Université de Paris V (Université René Descartes);Uppsala University";"NL;NO;IT;DE;UK;EL;ES;DK;CH;FI;FR;SE";

The work will include experimental investigations at industrial scale, and use sample workpieces of an appropriate size and configuration similar to their active counterparts. 

The work will proceed in 2 distinct stages. The first stage will involve the continued development of the Harwell Telerobotic Controller and its interface to NEATER, a Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot, and ancillary equipment and mechanisms. This development will allow in-active trials of a TMDSRS system on each of the 3 sets of target workpieces (3, 4 and 5). The work will be carried out in the Harwell Robotics Demonstration laboratory. 

The second stage of the work (6) will involve active trials of one of the areas demonstrated in the first stage. The selection of the appropriate application will ensure that a safe, useful and representative active trial can be accomplished. 

This development will reduce man-Sv and costs of decommissioning projects. Greater efficiencies in placing or deploying decontamination tools and in cutting and packing waste will improve waste disposal strategies, and reduce waste arisings. Data on cost benefits will be produced in submissions made to justify the selection of a suitable project for the active trials (phase 2). Cooperation on sensors with SCK/CEN Mol is included in the work programme. 
The objective of this work is to use existing equipment developed under the Harwell nuclear robotics programme to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of telerobotic monitoring, decontamination and size reduction systems (TMDSRS).

14450;R1091;ESP;;FP2-RACE 1;;FP2;Exploitation and Service Project;01/08/1989;31/12/1991;;"Application pilot projects require advanced communications facilities to link together their project sites.  Due to the complexity introduced by transborder communication, a consulting and assistance service is needed.  Therefore, the objectives of ESP - the Exploitation and Service Project - were:  

. to derive from the application pilots (APs) important criteria for the usage of future communication networks and to communicate these to the PNOs, to improve interworking of network provisions and application trials  
. to serve as a transnational focal point for support and advice to APs on the use of network facilities, counselling on appropriate interface specifications and protocols to establish connections, and to provide assistance in locating and resolving interface problems during trial operations on test- networks and testbeds.

Technical Approach  

The needs and plans of the individual APs differ from one another.  Therefore, ESP used communication scenarios to specify suitable commercially available services to support particular needs, and to support their usage within advanced test-networks.  An inherent mismatch between provisions and requirements for broadband services to support communication experiments soon became apparent.  ESP therefore extracted requirements based on the early experience gained by the APs, and recommended which recent standards might be found applicable.  ESP thus provided both a survey of available products for the APs, and suggestions on useful network enhancements, to the PNOs.  The bundling of results from application pilots in the area of broadband communications also ensured that intermediate results could be  more easily utilised commercially.  

Finally, in order to eliminate the discrepancies between:  
. offerings and needs  
. existing standards and future market requirements  
. properties of existing or planned technology and user needs.  

ESP recommended future broadband provisions and developments thought to be economically feasible on a European scale.  

Key Issues  
. A transnational focal point for advice to application pilots.  
. Appropriate network interface specifications, where protocols and suitable hardware / software are not readily available.  
. Practical assistance to APs and PNOs to locate and resolve interface problems.  
. Feedback of results and experiences to all actors concerned.  
. Transfer of knowledge gained to relevant standard organisations.  
. Proposals for the generalisation of the current ISO/OSI model taking into account the management and support of distributed, multimedia broadband applications.  

Achievements  
ESP partners became convinced of the need for an integrated communications platform, to support future test programmes.  By refining and applying its multimedia communication framework, ESP achieved greater synergy from parallel work undertaken by application pilots and network service providers. Prototype multimedia tele-services now need to be made available quickly, to verify ESP's results on a broader experience base.  These might best be supported by a technology-independent communications platform implemented in existing end-systems - made as close as possible to the infrastructure foreseen for B-ISDN. Such an approach provides the only feasible way to solve the 'chicken and egg' situation between available networks and possible applications.  

Data on the communication profiles used by APs, as collected and analysed by ESP, may now be used to support an intense discussion on appropriate standards, the benefits of future network technologies, and other related developments .  

The ESP project was originally conceived to support application pilots seeking to utilise broadband links on a trans-national basis within Europe, and taking advantage of special conditions offered by operators for such experiments.  In practice however, not all application pilots have found it necessary to span international borders in order to achieve valid results concerning future European tele-services.  Many practical difficulties were also encountered in various initiatives to establish trans-national experimental links.  ESP therefore recommends that greater use be made of existing national testbeds and test-networks; even if these cause some limitations on the geographic location of trial users that may be supported in any one experiment.  

Many of the questions, interim solutions and results which arose from the work in ESP are now the basis for a new RACE-project (CIO).";;;;;Detecon;DE;"BRITISH TELECOM PLC (BT);PTT Netherlands Research;France Cables et Radio;Telecom Portugal;Televerket NTA;Televerket STA;Broadcom Ltd;Kjobenhavns Telefon Aktieselskab;TELEFONICA SISTEMAS;Consorzio Pisa Ricerche";"UK;NL;FR;PT;NO;SE;IE;DK;ES;IT";

The objective of the project is to design and develop an intelligent real time system for signal understanding (AITRAS) which is knowledge based. AITRAS comprises a system shell and the design tools for building systems for the real time analysis and interpretation of instrumentation signals.
The intention was to design AITRAS around a real time inference engine (RTIE), tightly coupled to a signal processing subsystem, and to design and develop an architecture for real time environments.

The workplan for each application began with the elicitation of expert knowledge and the creation of the system specification. The demonstration of the AITRAS prototype followed. Static and dynamic validations were then made and the performance refined within an operational environment. Validation of the generic AITRAS system is carried out on 3 industrial applications:
the nondestructive examination of steam generator tubes in nucelar plants by the analysis of eddy current signals;
the use of the same technique for heat exchangers and condensers;
the fault prediction by the analysis of vibration signals for the maintenance of bearings.
Though sophisticated real-time techniques have been applied successfully in this field, for several reasons their success has been limited. The huge amount of data to be processed slows the response; the experts needed to interpret the results are in short supply; and even the use of knowledge-based systems to emulate expert reasoning does not reduce the delays sufficiently.

8261;3234;SUBSYM;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Self-Organisation and Analogical Modelling Using Sub-Symbolic Computing;01/08/1991;31/01/1994;;"The Action aims to obtain a better understanding of sub-symbolic artificial intelligence and sensorimotor tasks. Sub-symbolic AI uses representations which do not require programmer-specified relationships to link them in an arbitrary (conceptual) way to the represented objects. Two examples are: 
-Analogical representations: In these, relationships between the parts of a problem domain are captured directly in the representation. An example is a visual buffer, which is literally just a picture of a scene. The difference is that the picture is 'ac tive' - dynamic processes such as diffusion and reaction with objects enables an active object (moving car in a traffic scene, moving robot arm) to plan movements, This is because it 'knows' about the scene from the results of the initiated dynamic processes.Analogical representations are therefore explored in the form of a visual buffer which is used both to store expectations about a visual scene and to act as the medium in which sensorimotor actions are planned and monitored. 
-Neural representations: In these, learning algorithms are used to change the weights in a network in order to execute some task (classification, choosing a direction to move, finding features in an image). The ressulting computation is sub-symbolic because although the system performs the task, no-one told it how to, and the way in which it does it is not often easy to understand, as with real neural systems.Neural mechanisms are therefore used to learn and compute generalisations about scenes with moving or still objects, so that concepts can be used to describe the scene and hence give verbal instructions, or so that expectations can be generated by recognising that the scene is an instance of a general class.
Methods of sub-symbolic computing are explored, with applications that include robotics and vision. The sub-symbolic paradigms come from neural network learning algorithms and analogical representations mapped directly from the problem domain. The project employs a number of approaches. Firstly, a robot arm connected to a workstation, which grabs and moves target objects under the control of an internally maintained map. Reaction diffusion dynamics on the map define the relationships of the different objects and the arm, thus performing the sub-symbolic computations necessary for performing the tasks. Secondly, autonomous robots on wheels have been developed. These are grounded in the real world, receiving a richness of dynamical sensory input unattainable in simulation. This provides a new framework for exploring adaptive algorithms and situated intelligence. Thirdly, an internal map of a street scene is maintained and used to plan trajectories for traffic. The computational operations performed on the map include those of generalising, from examples, the generic forms of spatiotemporal events in order to build up sub-symbolic schemata for planning purposes. Fourthly, a reaction diffusion dynamics is executed on images to perform spatial filtering. Fifthly, a 2-dimensional network of coupled oscillators is used for path planning. Sixthly, a reinforcement connectionist learning algorithm is used, also for robotic path planning. Seventhly, a novel learning algorithm has been developed, based on a proposal for subcellular and circuit learning in real neurons. In addition, self-organising maps are explored, with application to scene analysis. The maps are used to evolve basic feature detectors appropriate to the images, and also in the construction of higher level descriptions. Multilayer maps are developed for representations with a hierarchy of resolutions.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The Action employs a number of approaches: 
-A robot arm connected to a workstation grabs and moves target objects under the control of an internally maintained map. Reaction-diffusion dynamics on the map define the relationships of the different objects and the arm, thus performing the sub-symbol ic computations necessary for performing the tasks. 
-Autonomous robots on wheels have been developed. These 'agents' are 'grounded' in the real world, receiving a richness of dynamical sensory input unattainable in simulation. This provides a new framework for exploring adaptive algorithms and 'situated'intelligence. 
-An internal map of a street scene is maintained and used to plan trajectories for traffic. The computational operations performed on the map include those of generalising, from examples, the generic forms of spatio-temporal events in order to build up s ub-symbolic schemata for planning purposes. 
-A reaction-diffusion dynamics is executed on images to perform spatial filtering. Edges can be found and noise removed using this novel technique. 
-A 2D network of coupled oscillators is used for path planning. The 'waves' interact with openings in 'walls' in order to enable the simulated robot to choose a path suitable for its size. 
-A reinforcement connectionist learning algorithm is used for robotic path planning. Two stages are involved: the building of an internal model of the workspace, and the construction of plans from particular starting configurations. 
-A novel learning algorithm is developed, based on a proposal for sub-cellular and circuit learning in real neurons. This algorithms enables circuits to self-organise to expect certain inputs and conduct 'internal simulations': dynamical processes analog ous to the input dynamics. 
-Self-organising maps are explored, with application to scene analysis. The maps are used to evolve basic feature detectors appropriate to the images, and also in the construction of higher-level descriptions. Multi-layer maps are developed for represent ations with a hierarchy of resolutions. 
-The theoretical foundations of the approach are being analysed and clarified. The ULB group has ongoing work on the application of dynamics for computation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The results of the Action consist of the above 9 tasks developing in parallel, with continuous cross-fertilisation of ideas. The diverse problem domains (image processing, navigation) are united by a bottom-up approach of allowing the complexity of the world to create the complexity of the organism. 
The VUB have had robots on display in various places, notably at the Seville Expo 92 and the Esprit Conference. The adaptive dynamics algorithm is becoming known to neuroscientists as a rationale for learning at the level of ion channels in the brain. Hamburg has implemented software which plans trajectories in traffic scenes, as well as feature extraction in images. The ULB has a Transputer-based demo of path-planning using the wave-method. The Spanish group have a program showing a simulated robotlearning complex path-planning using reinforcement learning. The Finnish group have developed a sophisticated scene-processing environment and can show their self-organising algorithms learning to extract regularities. 
A number of papers describing various of these methods have started to appear, some in journals and some in conference proceedings. 
POTENTIAL 
The short-term potential lies in contributions of new techniques for robotics, planning and scene analysis which emphasise the generation, rather than programming, of solutions. In the longer term, approaches like this are the only ones that are expected to pass a certain level of sophistication. Only by understanding how dynamic computation can interact with a world in flux can one hope to build robust adaptable machines.";;;;;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;BE;"Universität Hamburg;CENTRE D'ESTUDIS AVANCAIS DE BLANES;ROF NEVANLINNE INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE;UNIVERSITY OF LAPPEENRANTA;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL";"DE;ES;FI;CH;BE";

-control the factors governing the flow of electrons in crystalline charge-transfer molecular conductors 
-prepare new molecular crystals exhibiting 2-D conductivity in order to optimise conditions for superconductivity and, in particular, increase the critical temperature 
-elaborate and characterise new materials exhibiting extremely 1-D conducting properties for use as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) sensors 
-develop a simulation computer programme allowing the prediction of possible obtainable crystal structures starting from a given molecule 
-establish guidelines for the synthesis of new materials by modelling their electronic properties. 
A computer program was developed to simulate the geometric arrangement of the building blocks in a crystal and the specific properties of individual molecules.
Factors governing the flow of electrons in organic conductors were investigated. A better understanding of this is needed before organic conductors can be used in the fabrication of microelectronics components. Compounds with various degrees of one dimensionality and disorder were prepared and their physical properties studied.

The new donor molecule (TMDTDSF) of the TMTSF type but comprising 2 sulphur and 2 selenium atoms has demonstrated the possibility of tailoring materials of the (TM)2X series. The role of disorder between conducting chains has been investigated by preparing solid solutions. The formation of a solid solution has been established by the x-dependence of the c-lattice parameter. The transport properties at low temperature do not seem to be crucially affected by the weak off chain disorder. However, some effects of the alloying have been detected on the transition temperature towards a spin density wave (SDW) state and the depinning of the SDW.
An oscillating component of the SDW current has been observed with a frequency proportional to the direct current SDW current (TMTSF)2PF6. Theoretical derivation has been achieved of the weak localization correction to the conductivity for a strongly anisotropic 2-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a magnetic field.
Study has been carried out of the alpha-phase of the family (perylene)2[M(mnt)2] involving transport, X-ray and magnetism. Tris-tetrathiafulvalene derivative of triptycene has been synthesized and the growth conditions for the largest superconducting transition in (ET)2Cu(SCN)2 have been optimized.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The materials to be studied can be considered as a loose assembly of units of reduced dimensionality (chains or planes for 1-D and 2-D respectively) in which the molecules are more tightly and strongly packed than between units. Electronic conduction in these materials proceeds via intermolecular electron transfer (along chains or within planes for 2-D materials). Localisation is expected to occur for vanishingly small overlap integrals between molecules. This localisation was to studied through the effects that the temperature and pressure have on: 
-structure (averaged and lattice distortions) 
-transport properties in the presence of a controlled disorder (obtained by alloying or irradiation) 
-intermolecular or interchain disorder and the role of Coulomb forces on the localisation. 
-the role of band fitting (commensurability) on the conducting properties 
-the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties (high-resolution NMR techniques in solids are being adapted for molecular conductors). 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Various conducting systems exhibiting a controlled disorder have been synthesised: 
-The new donor molecule (TMDTDSF) of the TMTSF type but comprising two sulphur and two selenium atoms has demonstrated the possibility of tailoring materials of the (TM)2X series which lie between (TMTTF)2X and (TMTSF)2X salts in the generic phase diagra m of these materials. 
-The role of disorder between conducting chains has been investigated by preparing solid solutions such as (TMTSF)2AsF6(1-x)SbF6x. The formation of a solid solution has been established by the x-dependence of the c-lattice parameter. The transport proper ties at low temperature (but T > Tsdw) do not seem to be crucially affected by the weak off-chain disorder. However, some effects of the alloying have been detected on the transition temperature towards a SDW state and the depinning of the SDW condensate.-First observation of an oscillating component of the SDW current with a frequency proportional to the dc SDW current in (TMTSF)2PF6. 
-Theoretical derivation of the weak localisation correction to the conductivity for a strongly anisotropic 2D electron gas in the presence of a magnetic field. 
-Study of the alpha-phase of the family (perylene)2[M(mnt)2] with M=Au, Pt, Pd, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu. Transport, X-ray and magnetism (EPR, susceptibility and NMR) have been studied for M=Au, Cu (diamagnetic acceptors), M=Pt, Pd, Ni, (uniform chain of S=1/2 spi ns), M=Fe (dimerised chain of S=1/2 spins). 
-Tris-tetrathiafulvalene derivative of triptycene has been synthesised. 
-The growth conditions for the largest superconducting transition in (ET)2Cu(SCN)2 have been optimised. 
- A strong and 'normal' isotope effect on Tc is observed in H - (ET)2I3 when both central carbons in the ET molecule are replaced by 13C isotopes. 
POTENTIAL 
A fairly complete understanding of the generic phase diagram of Bechgaard-like materials has been reached. 
Contrary to previous results, it seems that a weak anion disorder does not affect significantly the conductivity properties, although finite effects are seen on the establishment of the SDW ground state and the depinning of the SDW condensate. 
A new channel of collective conduction through SDW sliding has been evidence by the generation of an AC current. 
The first step towards the fabrication of 2-D organic conductors has been achieved with the synthesis of triptycene molecules.";;;;;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;FR;"ASSOCIACAO PARA O DESENVOLVIMENTO DO INSTITUTO SUPERIOR TECNICO;HC OERSTED INSTITUTE;INETI-ICEN";"PT;DK";
18105;2614;NIRO;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Neutral Interfaces for Robotics;15/12/1989;14/12/1990;;"The objective of the project is to develop neutral interfaces and neutral data formats for the exchange of geometrical, technological and programming functions and data between CAD, robot planning and robot control. The user-oriented robot programming language is treated as an interface, between the programmer and the programming system. These developments will be based on formal techniques for specifying the interfaces that are relevant for the robotic application area. In this sense, the proposed project follows the approach of ESPRIT project 322 and extends its scope into the robotics domain. 
Standardization of the product description interface between computer aided design (CAD) and manufacturing application systems, as well as of the explicit machine control (EMC) description interface between these and the real time production equipment, are prerequisites for the implementation of computer integrated manufacturing and engineering (CIME) systems. Standardization will allow software components and production machines to be replaced by more effective ones as they appear on the market, leading to the application of customized CIME systems based on multiple vendors. The project deals with the definition of a neutral description of the kinematics of machanisms as part of the product description interface, and with the establishment of an intermediate code for robot explicit control, as part of the EMC interface. It also deals with a neutral, high level programming language for robots. Selected aspects of the EMC description interface for robotics applications are discussed. Examples that illustrate the exchange formats of the interfaces are presented. An industrial application is described, concerning the welding of modular ship sections. The influence of the project on standardization efforts is addressed.
The main aim is to develop processors, software tools and methods that will enable multivendor systems to be put together. An important topic of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by constructing prototypes to prove the inter-communication capabilities between systems built from multivendor modules. 

The development of neutral interfaces consists basically of the following steps: 

- identification of the relevant interfaces 
- identification of the information representing the functions and data for planning, programming and program execution in robotics which have to flow across the interfaces 
- formal specification of the data types and statements and their semantics and syntactical representation 
- development, testing and enhancement of processors 
- implementation of the software tools in an industrial environment

8243;3327;SUPRADYNAMICS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Lattice Dynamics of High-Tc Single Crystal Superconductors;01/06/1989;31/05/1991;;"Parallel investigations have been developed on copper and nickel compounds with the simplest La2CuO4 structure (synthesis, crystal growth, spectroscopic studies). Also, to discriminate between the role of phononic and magnetic interactions, the search forsuperconductivity in oxides which do not contain any magnetic ions has been undertaken. 
The aims of the Action were to: 
-Acquire a precise knowledge of the phase diagram of the Y2O3-CuO-BaO system. 
-Optimise the crystal growth of large good-quality samples. 
-Measure complete phonon dispersion curves by inelastic neutron scattering. 
-Understand the basic lattice dynamics of oxide superconductors, and search for the signature of highly-anharmonic motions and determine their role in the mechanism of superconductivity.
The mechanisms underlying the superconductivity of oxides with a high critical temperature have been investigated. Research focused on the role played by atomic lattice vibrations. These phenomena were measured by inelastic neutron scattering, a technique requiring large (about 1 cm cubed) single crystals. To this end, the growth of large high quality yttrium barium copper oxide single crystals has been improved through developing a new method of growth in a nonpolluting crucible. Much has been learned about the phase diagraam of YBaCuO and crystal growth. Crystals of YBaCuO as large as 7 by 5 mm were obtained, but their thickness along the direction of the c-axis remains submillimetric. Their small thickness, however, favoured oxygen isotope exchange, the first report of temperature dependence of relaxation times of oxygen-17 in-plane oxygen with a single crystal. Several crystals of lanthanum nickel oxide (La2NiO4), praeseodymium nickel oxide (Pr2NiO4), lanthanum copper oxide (La2CuO4) and yittrium barium copper oxide (YBaCuO6; YBaCuO7) have been measured by inelastic neutron scattering. It has been shown that there exists a tendency towards general lattice softening upon reaching electronic concentrations known to enable the appearance of superconductivity. A parallel approach towards the insular metal transition in systems isostructural of La2CuO4, but not containing any magnetic ion, has partly succeeded with the discovery of a new system barium potassium lead bismuth oxide ((Ba(1-x)Kx)2Pb(1-y)BiYO4) which can be cycled from insulating to highly conducting states by a simple treatment with argon or oxygen.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The absence of congruent melting of Y-Ba-Cu-O requires a flux method for crystallisation using BaO-CuO melts as a solvent. The determination of the domain of primary crystallisation has been achieved. With the original growth method in the yttrium-oxide crucible, the starting material is the composition of the binary eutectic 7 BaO-18 CuO. 
Y-Ba-Cu-O crystals display a sharp transition (2 degrees wide) to the superconducting state at 90 K. The partners in this Action each provided their specific capabilities to join in the material characterisation process. The crystals' quality allowed original measurements by nuclear magnetic resonance in the group of D. Jerome at Orsay and by infrared reflectivity spectroscopy at Orlans. 
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed with the German high-performance spectrometer located at the Orphe reactor at Saclay. Lattice dynamics calculations were done at KF Karlsruhe with a shell model and anisotropic screening by mobilecharge carriers. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Much has been learned about the phase diagram of YBaCuO and crystal growth. Several new ways have been suggested, but a lot of effort is still required. Crystals of YBaCuO as large as 7 x 5 mm were obtained, but their thickness along the direction of the c-axis remains sub-millimetric. Their small thickness, however, favoured oxygen isotope exchange (16O - 17O) performed at CRPHT, an experiment preceding the NMR studies of 17O performed at Orsay, and the first report of temperature dependence of relaxation times of 17O in-plane oxygen with a single crystal. 
Several crystals of La2NiO4, Pr2NiO4, La2CuO4 and YBaCuO (O6 to O7) have been measured by inelastic neutron scattering by the KFA team at LLB, Saclay. It has been shown that there exists a tendency towards general lattice softening upon reaching electronic concentrations known to enable the appearance of superconductivity. 
A parallel approach towards the insular-metal transition in systems isostructural of La2CuO4, but not containing any magnetic ion, has partly succeeded with the discovery of a new system (Ba1-xKx)2Pb1-yBiyO4 which can be cycled from insulating to highly conducting states by a simple treatment with argon or oxygen. 
POTENTIAL 
One application of the phase diagram studies deals with a way to improve critical current densities in textured ceramics of YBaCuO. This material remains the only superconductor at a temperature well above that of ebulition of nitrogen, thought to allow the development of specific high-performance electronic devices at liquid nitrogen temperature. 
The conclusion of the Kanazawa (Japan, July 1991) conference on superconductivity was that there is still no consensus about the mechanism of superconductivity in oxides. New families based on carbon have been discovered in the meantime, showing that the phenomenon might be much more general than anticipated. The essential argument which had been invoked to reject a mechanism based on pairing via phonons is the weakness of the isotope effect of oxygen, which now appears not to be so small as originally claimed. The initial approach - to explore the lattice dynamics - which encountered scepticism when the Action began, has been shown to be a valuable one provided it is not restricted to the harmonic approximation. The apical oxygen, sitting in a sandwich position between the conducting and 'reservoir' planes, is sensitive to an electric field which varies with electronic concentration, possibly leading to different regimes, including the highly anharmonic, consistent with an interpretation of X-ray absorpti n experiments in terms of double-well potential for apical oxygen.";;;;;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);FR;Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Technik und Umwelt GmbH;DE;

A document management system has been developed with the following features: 

Tools for importing multimedia documents and document parts in order to store, reuse, edit and print them on the system and for exporting them to other environments. These tools include conversions between internal format and office document interchange format (ODIF), desktop publishing formats and standard generalised markup language (SGML) (for some specific document type definitions (DTD), including the CALS group of DTDs). 

A converter from the STEP format into 3-dimensional graphical data, allowing their visualization and an interactive 3-dimensional-2-dimensional converter storing 2-dimensional views of the data. These 2-dimensional views can be included in a document as vector or as bitmap graphical data. 

A document editor for the production of multimedia documents, for which an existing commercial editor is used, supplemented with a dedicated office document architecture (ODA) document class editor. 

A technical document management module enabling storage, search and retrieval of documents and document parts using management and reference data; this module also allows the organization and control work flow of document production and maintenance. 

An advanced communication module providing distributed open systems interconnection (OSI) access to documents and document parts. X.400 and DTAM are used. 

A modular approach in the system architecture allows replacement of the document editor by another and of the database server module by another (for which any structured query language (SQL) server can be used).
Important new features of FODATEC are the use of ODA attributes to index and retrieve document parts, both locally and remotely, and to add management information to document constituents at all levels. This allows multi- authoring and version management at document part level. Also important is the possibility to introduce STEP engineering data directly as graphics into documents. 

The FODATEC tools allow the use of international and industry standards such as ODA, SGML, STEP and SQL for document production, storage and retrieval. The adherence to such standards is becoming a vital element of technical documentation systems, given the regulatory initiatives in several industries such as the defence, aviation and automotive industry. It also safeguards investments made in production systems for the coming years. 

A production and management environment for technical documents has been developed as an integrated software system. It allows the integration of 3D product data, vector and raster graphics and text into documents on paper or in electronic format (in document databases or published on optical media).

8230;1665;SEMAGRAPH;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;The Semantics and Pragmatics of Generalised Graph Rewriting;01/07/1989;30/06/1992;;"The principal objective of the SEMAGRAPH Action was to develop knowledge relevant to the semantics and pragmatics of computing by graph transformations, also known as generalised graph rewriting. 
Generalised Graph rewriting extends term rewriting notions to include sharing, multiple non-root rewriting and explicit control of reduction order. These can be used for optimised reduction, side effects and process communication and synchronisation. These extensions provide a potentially unifying framework for a variety of models of computation, including functional languages, logical languages, object oriented languages, parallel generalisations of imperative languages.
The research aimed to develop the theory and practice of computing by graph transformation, and to relate these to existing theory especially abstract interpretation and the theory of orthogonal term rewriting systems. Implementation work ranges from sequential interpreters for graph rewriting languages to experiments with parallel machines. Efficient normalizing techniques for lambda terms are a case study for the theory and practice.

A common model of term graph rewriting (TGR) was developed.
The SEMAGRAPH work on establishing the foundations of TGR has been extremely fruitful. Its foundation is the extension of classical term rewriting to handle tranfinite rewriting sequences and infinite terms. This allows classical notions, such as Levy equivalence, neededness, typing and strictnes analysis to be mapped to the TGR world. The CAIMENS work on explicit substitutions is clearly seminal for tree based semantics, and there are now signs of a surprising connection with graph rewriting. Overall, SEMAGRAPH's theoretical contributions are certain to be of increasing importance as workers in Functional, Logic, Object and other higher level languages recognize the importance of understanding rewriting with sharing. With respect to state of the art sequential implementations which poutperform classical languages an impressive envirnonment has been developed for functional programming using the Concurrent Clean model of computation. The implementation includes many advanced optimization features, and the sequential performance is state of the art for a lazy functional language. Real speedups on experimental parallel implementations involves work on integrating the fast sequential compiler technology with the parallel distributed evaluation architecture ZAPP producing impressive performance figures. The formal exchange of standard, stable, interfaces between Concurrent clean compilers and ZAPP is regarded as an important milestone: it will provide a proper basis for study ing a range of distribution mechanisms without needing to modify the top end of the compilation route.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The Action was divided into three areas of work: 
Semantic foundations. Both categorical and operational semantics were explored and related to existing term rewriting theory. Appropriate type systems were sought, and existing abstract interpretation techniques extended. 
Language design and implementation. Practical experiments examined existing and novel designs and implementations and sought methods for expressing the control of reduction order. 
Case study. Efficient strong reduction techniques for the lambda calculus (the basis of all functional programming languages) were explored. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Deliverables at the end of the Action contained over 60 scientific papers, most published, and several state-of-the-art prototypes of graph rewriting systems. The major achievements were: 
-A common model of graph rewriting: The partners, who started with different notions of graph rewriting, have increasingly focused the term graph rewriting (TGR) model. This identification of a common model is a major achievement. 
-Theoretical foundations: The SEMAGRAPH work on establishing the foundations of Term Graph Rewriting has been extremely fruitful. Its foundation is the extension of classical term rewriting to handle tranfinite rewriting sequences and infinite terms. Thi s allows classical notions, such as Levy equivalence, neededness, typing, and strictness analysis to be mapped to the term graph rewriting world. Interestingly, there has also been a 'backward' transfer of ideas: the abstract reduction technique, develope d for term graphs, is now being investigated in more classical contexts. The CAIMENS work on explicit substitutions is clearly seminal for tree based semantics, and there are now signs of a surprising connection with graph rewriting. Overall, SEMAGRAPH's theoretical contributions are certain to be of increasing importance as workers in Functional, Logic, Object and other higher level languages recognise the importance of understanding rewriting with sharing. 
-State-of-the-art sequential implementations which poutperform classical languages: Nijmegen have developed an impressive environment for functional programming using the Concurrent Clean model of computation. The implementation includes many advanced op timisation features, and the sequential performance is state-of-the-art for a lazy functional language. The environment has been widely distributed on the Macintosh, and demonstrated at CEBIT'92 in Hanover. 
-Real speedups on experimental parallel implementations: The KUN/UEA work on integrating the fast sequential compiler technology of Nijmegen with the parallel distributed evaluation architecture ZAPP is producing impressive performance figures. The forma l exchange of standard, stable, interfaces between Concurrent Clean compilers and ZAPP is regarded as an important milestone: it will provide a proper basis for studying a range of distribution mechanisms without needing to modify the top end of the compilation route.

The objective of FELICITA was to develop ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) technology to the point where FLC devices can be produced competitively within Europe. Ferroelectric liquid crystals combine the well known advantages of conventional liquid crystals with the additional advantages of very fast switching and bistable operation.
The project concentrated on 2 types of device: an A4 display suitable for an office terminal and a xerographic printhead based on an FLC shutter array. A4 displays with 640 x 400 and 1280 x 800 pixels were fabricated, and a 100 mm diagonal video display with 240 x 256 pixels was demonstrated. The final display demonstrator, a 640 x 480 pixel, 64-colour A4 display, is presently being fabricated. A 75 mm, 300 dots per inch (dpi) shutter array with a frame time of 308 ms has been completed and tested in an electrographic printer. The device exhibits a 20:1 contrast ratio, and the first results have already demonstrated the feasibility of quality, high speed printing using FLC technology. The project has also developed computer programs which simulate the optical and electrical characteristics of ferroelectric liquid crystal display (LCD).
The workpackages of the project covered the areas of fundamental studies, the development and evaluation of liquid crystal (LC) materials, electronics, colour and grey scale technologies, and displays and light shutter fabrication technology. The fabrication work has developed the technology required to ensure that high quality devices can be produced with high quality devices can be produced with high yield. The colour and grey scale workpackages have ensured that the display can compete effectively with other display technologies for the office terminal market. FLC materials have been developed which enable both the displays and shutters to meet market requirements for operating speed, temperature range and lifetime. Under the electronics workpackage the integrated circuits (IC) needed to drive these complex devices have been designed alongside the development of the addressing schemes.
Ferroelectric liquid crystals combine the well-known advantages of conventional liquid crystals with the additional advantages of very fast switching and bistable operation.

The project is developing an advanced human computer interface to support cooperative dialogue between users and knowledge based systems. The interface supports natural language, command language, graphical display, direct manipulation and gesture. Several tools are incorporated to allow the graphical visualization of the state of the knowledge base, its suggested designs for local area computer networks, and interactive charts and graphs. The mechanism for designing and presenting these visualizations which also supports the interaction of the graphical mode with other modes is described.

The project undertakes research into multimodal interfaces to knowledge based systems (KBS).
Such as interface will allow the user to communicate with the underlying application KBS using natural language, direct manipulation and gesture, as well as a command language. It will also allow the application to communicate with the user through natural language and structured graphics. Natural language modules will be developed for English, French and Spanish. The ergonomic aspects of the interface will receive special attention in order to maximize its readability and efficiency and favour its use even in real time situations.
The interface will incorporate a dialogue management and mode selection system which will use knowledge of the specificites of individual modes, of the context of previous interactions, and of the application domain to determine the content of system output and select the most appropriate mode in which to present particular information. A user modelling module will interact with dialogue management, so that the system will react appropriately to different classes of users and individual users.
The interface developed is designed to be portable across a range of potential applications of Prolog based KBS.

Work so far has concentrated on designing the architecture and operating principles of the interface system and on preparing prototypes of each mode. A prototype was developed that demonstrates an initial implementation of the system's modules. The final phase concentrated on an extension of the system's intelligent interaction capabilities and on the exploitation of the research results in an industrial setting.
The interface allows the user to communicate with the underlying application KBS using natural language, direct manipulation and gesture, as well as a command language. It also allows the application to communicate with the user through natural language and structured graphics. Natural language modules are developed for English, French and Spanish. The English system is based on previous results and prototypes built during an ESPRIT I project (LOKI). The ergonomic aspects of the interface receive special attention in order to maximise user friendliness and efficiency and allow for use even in real-time situations. 

The interface incorporates a dialogue management and mode selection system which uses knowledge of the specificities of individual modes, knowledge of the context of previous interactions, and knowledge of the application domain to determine the content of system output and to select the most appropriate mode in which to present particular information. A user modelling module interacts with dialogue management, in order to allow the system to react appropriately to different classes of users and different types of individual users. 

The interface developed is designed to be portable across a range of potential applications of Prolog-based KBS.

8603;2638;ADOT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Advanced Display Optimisation Tools;01/03/1989;31/08/1990;;"Flat-panel display (FPD) manufacturers are currently faced with the problem of producing high resolution, high brightness large-format displays capable of full-colour imagery and complex symbols. In order to optimise display characteristics it is necessary to understand the relationship between the specification of the physical output from a display and the effects of such a specification on human vision. 

The aim of the ADOT project was to research and develop design tools for the optimisation of advanced display performance at the visual display interface in IT products.

This work is needed because there is a lack of acceptable quantitative display design criteria. The design tools, in the form of a computer program for a desk-top workstation, will consist of a database, mathematical models and metrics, evaluation methods and guidelines. Together with simulators, these utilities will assist the visual interface designer in: 

- optimising display parameters with due regard to visual performance and the environment 
- specifying the requirements for future advanced displays 
- comparing display types on a consistent basis to make the best use of existing and potential display technologies. 

The scope of the programme is purposely restricted to specific visual tasks such as the perception of symbols on complex, textured backgrounds typical of digital mapping and 3-D animation for simulation, and the manipulation of displayed text for office systems. The work plan has three main areas: 

Colour and Motion Perception 
Experiments will be carried out to provide guidelines for quantifying chromatic image quality, emphasising the spatial artefacts of flat-panel displays, the optimum combination of parameters required to perceive continuous motion, and the development of a colour space for luminous displays which can correctly represent the ease with which high-contrast information can be seen. 

Development of Design Tools 
Quantitative design criteria and guidelines will be developed from the results of the first work area. This will involve a systematic process of data reduction necessary for the formulation of metrics. These will be implemented in a computer program which will also be capable of emulating some physical characteristics for selected display technologies. The work will use the results and simulator from ESPRIT project 1593. 

Demonstrators 
Five demonstrators will form the major deliverable items and will show how the results of the project can be used to solve practical display problems facing the Community. These demonstrations will be carried out on a range of sophisticated existing workstations. 

The tools developed will be essential for the accurate specification of future displays, allowing development in this area to proceed more rapidly and cheaply than could otherwise have been possible. In part this will have been facilitated by the joint development of acceptable design criteria between display manufacturer, systems designer and user, as represented by the consortium and the international standing of its members. The use of a common design basis will be an important asset in the development of a European FPD market by promoting greater homogeneity of display characteristics and acceptable user requirements.";;;;;British Aerospace plc;UK;"TNO NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FOR APPLIED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH;OCE NEDERLAND;SOGITEC";"NL;FR";

The aim of this project is to significantly increase the electrostatic discharge (ESD) hardness of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies in the submicron range by improving the understanding of ESD phenomena and developing technology independent guidelines based on a detailed investigation of relevant parameters and realistic stress models.
Several types of ESD testers and stress models (human body, charged device and machine models), used to determine the ESD hardness of integrated circuits, are being characterised, and are being shown to give nonconformal results, even within the limits of the existing military (MIL) standards. The results will be further correlated with field returns. A proposal for the standardisation of ESD stress models and related procedures is being set up and is under discussion in the standardization group for ESD testing. Several new types of ESD testers related to charged device model testing are being compared with the prototype built in this project.
Failure criteria characterizing the effectiveness of ESD protection measures with respect to fatal and latent damage are being defined. Besides bulk CMOS, particular attention is being paid to problems specific to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies, where energy dissipation is considerably hampered by the isolated structure, and conventional protectioncircuits cannot be used adequately. Layout variations of devices, different types of devices, protection circuits with varied device combinations, and protected circuits are being investigated with respect to the different failure criteria. Adequate monitor circuits have been developed. An initial set of guidelines for improving the ESD hardness for processes and circuits its being generated. The influence of different packages on failure mechanisms and thresholds will also be considered. Complex electrothermal simulation tools, capable of handling the ESD-relevant voltage and current ranges as well as time and fr equency domains, will be developed. They will be verified and improved using the experimental results and failure analysis data available from the 2 previous workpackages, and will provide the basis for designing tailor made protection solutions for future generations of integrated circuits (IC).
Submicron CMOS technologies show increased sensitivity to electrostatic discharge (ESD) due to reduced gate oxide thickness, shallow junctions, lightly doped drain and lack of high resistive interconnections, which tend to reduce circuit reliability. On the other hand, the need for high pin counts, high signal frequencies and advanced analogue performance puts even higher demands on reliability. As a consequence, a special tailor-made protection strategy preventing the inner logic from being damaged by ESD voltages and currents must be found for each application so as to reconcile these opposing trends. Because of the complexity of the problem, reliable guidelines for the optimised design of future protection systems are needed, but are not yet available.";;;;;SIEMENS AG;DE;"NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;Technische Universitaet Muenchen;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"NL;DE;BE";

The main objective of the ACCESS project is to define cost effective solutions for a fibre based customer access connection (CAC), mainly for residential customers. This should compete with copper solutions on the basis of services used today, and serve as platform for a subsequent development to serve business customers and evolution towards integrated broadband communications (IBC).
CAC for 622 Mbits{-1} services has resulted in the definition of a flexible CAC able to support services in a future IBC for residential and business customers, definition of an overall demonstrator configuration with the design and evaluation of key optoelectronic components and modules and overall systems evaluations including cost evaluations.

Technical Approach  

The first three years of the project were devoted to definition of a CAC based on digital transmission, capable of carrying 622 Mbit/s services.  The main effort during '91 and '92 is devoted to definition and design of a CAC for residential customers with near term service requirements.  This is to be based on subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) technique.  

The technical approach for the work during 1991 and 1992 is:  

- Definition of a low cost CAC for residential customers taking into account performance and cost of components, installation and life cycle cost.  Specification, development and evaluation of key components.  
- Design of laboratory demonstrators of terminal equipment and EDFAs.  
- System evaluations including results from demonstrator design, cost estimations, operation and maintenance requirements, reliability, security and safety issues. Evaluation of upgrading possibilities to IBC.  
- Redefinition of the low cost CAC taking into account evaluation results.  
- Contribution to standardisation activities.  

The work is organised as four sub-projects, ie: consolidation of the technical work including performance, cost and system definitions / evaluations; development of a low cost transceiver for broadband application; system aspects and key technologies for a CAC based on fibre sharing; and evaluation of passive network structures with a shared topology.  

Key Issues  

- A passive optical network to be cost competitive with copper for residential subscribers demanding POTS and TV services.

As distributed computing becomes the norm, the requirements for interworking between graphics and networking standards become more acute.
The objectives of the project are to advance the state of the art in the transfer of graphical information across international networks and to improve the quality and applicability of standards in this area. The project has devised a classification scheme for applications in terms of their requirements for graphics and networking services. As a result of this a prototype application was selected for an application demonstration which will show how the computer graphic metafile (CGM) and file transfer access and management (FTAM) standards can be used together to enable remote access to individual pictures within a CGM. This uses a CGM FTAM document type developed within the project, which is now being standardized. The project has also contributed to an EWOS technical guide defining a mapping of the X-Window system onto an open system interconnection (OSI) stack. An ASN-1 description of the CGM standard's functional description is also defined within the project.

As distributed computing becomes the norm, the requirements for interworking between graphics and networking standards become more acute.
The project provided a forum in which European input to the development of graphics standards can be coordinated, requirements for future standards ascertained, and information on usage collated. Participants in the project engaged in national body and International Standardization Organization (ISO) standardization activities specifically related to the harmonization of graphics and networking standards.

The project produced the computer graphic metafile file transfer, access and management (CGM FTAM) document type and introduced this into the standardization process. The project contributed to the development of the EWOS Technical Guide on X over OSI mapping. The consortium also began work on an ASN 1 coding for computer graphic metafile (CGM); although this was not completed it created an opportunity for collaborative work between ISO International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) working groups in OSI and computer graphics and imaging. The classification of applications was successfully completed and reported on in the USA and Europe.

A route planning application was demonstrated which ran on heterogeneous hardware and transferred graphical information from sites in 4 Community member states. 3 European implementations of the file transfer, access and management (FTAM) international standard and 2 European implementations of the CGM international standard interworked to transfer the data. Implementations of the CGM FTAM document type developed in the project were used.
ARGOSI acknowledges the work that already exists in standardisation bodies. The project will provide a forum in which European input to the development of graphics standards can be coordinated, requirements for future standards ascertained, and information on usage collated. Participants in the project will engage in national body and ISO standardisation activities specifically related to the harmonisation of graphics and networking standards. This will enhance Europe's contribution and influence in these areas, and strengthen the position of the industrial partners in the consortium in terms of their ability to offer commercial products, both at the infrastructure and at the application levels, which are soundly based on international standards. The project expects to organise a number of workshops on graphics and networking to obtain a broad spectrum of views. 

A wide range of applications will be classified in terms of their needs in terms of graphics, networking and other required services. The extent to which these can be satisfied by existing or emerging standards will be assessed. Recommendations to standards bodies will then follow. 

The project will construct one major demonstration of graphics and networking services for a carefully chosen realistic prototype application. The demonstration will concern a geographical application where a user will be able to consult distant graphical data over a map. The demonstrator will be implemented on Unix-based workstations to allow for the easy dissemination of the results amongst the partners and other computer users. It is expected that the implementation of the graphics and networking standards developed in the project (enhanced where necessary to establish interworking) will emerge as commercial products. These results will also be fed into the standardisation process.

Information storage and retrieval techniques that allow the user to be 'guided' will become increasingly necessary, due to the massive volumes of information involved. There is also a strong need for CASE tools to support design and implementation of multimedia applications for CD-ROM and on the new broadband networks. 

SHAPE is a portable software environment comparable to a CASE tool that will greatly facilitate the realisation of complex CD-ROM based multimedia applications for large organisations, both private and public. The project addresses important issues now constraining the implementation of professional multimedia applications: 

- first-generation hypermedia provide poor embedded semantic information for links and objects 
- current multimedia systems show limitations concerning portability openness to other environments and flexibility with respect to user requirements 
- manual operations in application building are not supported, resulting in high implementation costs.
A portable software environment comparable to a computer aided systems engineering (CASE) tool that will greatly facilitate the realization of complex compact disc read only memory (CD ROM) based multimedia applications for large organizations, both private and public, has been developed. Hypermedia links provide powerful and user friendly navigation through multimedia databases. However, the design and the implementation of hypermedia is presently constrained by the type of link, the fact that links must be introduced manually, and the fact that links are software dependent and therefore not portable. The system demonstrates to what extent the use of object oriented tools, along with tags in text files and graphic files, can: 
diversify the type of links; 
optimise the process by using classes of links for specific classes of objects; 
provide standardized hypermedia links that are made software independent by using standard tags. 

The use of object oriented tools allows the construction of navigation tools not only for navigation through the actual information units (ie data), but also through semantic networks of reference information, such as concept descriptors or key words. 

A set of tools has been constructed that will allow the flexible semicustom design and implementation of applications. These will reduce costs and development time, improve the quality of designs and provide standardized interfaces for possible custom features.

In practice many incidents result from jet fires impinging on a localized area of the vessel. This can lead to severe localized heating and hence premature vessel failure. The project concerns the quantification of specific hazards posed by the production, storage, and transportation of flammable gases and pressurized liquefied gases, such as a fire involving a storage tank, which is both a common and potentially serious hazard in the petrochemical industry and during the transportation of flammable and toxic materials. 

There are 5 main work programmes as follows. 
Quantifying and modelling of jet fires: modelling of unobstructed jet fires, including effects of 2-phase releases, pressure releases, lift off and turbulence. 
Quantifying the interaction between obstacle and the fire: modelling of jet fires engulfing small obstacles, such as pipework, and modelling of jet fires impinging on large obstacles such as storage vessels. 
Modelling the thermal response of a pressure vessel: the thermal response of a vessel containing pressurized liquids and nearby flange connections to partial heating by jet fire impingment will be described. 
The effectiveness of 3 types of mitigation measures, water spray cooling, insulation and fire walls, will be assessed with respect to jet fire attack. 
A limited number of field tests will be used to study the failure modes of pressure vessels under jet fire attack.

As the participants intend to increase con tacts with their colleagues to solve the numerous problems that have arisen in this fundamental area of computer science, this Working Group was dedicated to organising workshops and joint seminars to provide a framework for participants to come together and share ideas, methods and results.
A collection of researchers collaborated on problems of mutual interest in algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science. This included combinatorics on words and theory of codes, formal language and grammar theory, theory of automata, process algebras and infinite behaviours of parallel programs and systems.

Numerous bilateral exchanges have been supported by the algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science (ASMICS) project; 5 specialized workshops and 2 general ASMICS meetings have been organized.
Some new themes closely related to automata theory have been emphasized such as dynamical systems, temporal logic, tiling and geometrical problems, and synchronization.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The research that can be undertaken in the field of algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science can be grouped under four headings: 
-combinatorics on words and theory of codes 
-formal language and grammar theory to define sets of words, sets of trees, sets of images 
-theory of automata corresponding to given languages 
-process algebras and infinite behaviours of parallel programs and systems. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS OF OCTOBER 1991 
Numerous bilateral exchanges have been supported by ASMICS; five specialised workshops and two general ASMICS meetings have already been organised (see below), and several others are planned. 
A steady stream of papers have been written by ASMICS members. Some new themes closely related to automata theory have been emphasised such as dynamical systems, temporal logic, tiling and geometrical problems, synchronisation.

8215;3245;LF;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Logical Frameworks: Design, Implementation and Experiment;01/06/1989;31/03/1992;;"There has been a steady increase recently in research towards systems that can provide assistance with reasoning about a variety of problems. Examples of such systems include operational semantics, lambda calculi, and verification systems for the development of hardware and software. 
Such systems must provide a user-friendly, problem-specific environment for the development of formal proofs because they must be usable by programmers and hardware designers who are not experts in logic. A key objective of the research is to understand the relationships among these systems. 
The overall aim of the LF Action was to design a proof development environment that is logic-independent, accepting a specification of the logic to be used and yielding a proof development environment for that logic.
Research on logical systems for formal reasoning as programming systems was undertaken. Various formal systems relevant to computer science were designed, investigated and implemented. The formal systems are all centred around typed lambda calculi. The results should provide the software writer with programming environments that facilitate certification of software.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The task of implementing a proof development environment for a given logic is at first sight discouraging, and there is considerable duplication between implementations of different logics. The task can be eased, however, by developing a unifying theory of formal systems. 
The 'logical framework' is just such a unifying theory: it provides a concise notation and calculus for specifying logics, and will eliminate, to a large extent, the redundancy between implementations, so that systems for a variety of logics can be rapidly prototyped. 
The participants experimented with various systems as frameworks in which to conduct formal proofs, including AUTOMATH-related type theories with variants of Church's higher-order logic, and a general system of operational semantics. The experience gainedin such endeavours is among the principal results of the collaboration. 
Collaboration among the participants is enhanced by adopting one programming language in which most prototype software is written. This is ML, a functional programming language oriented toward symbolic computation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
It appears, on present evidence, that a basic component of a unifying framework is some form of typed lambda calculus. Furthermore, a common feature of implementations is their ability to provide the user with proof-search procedures. The progress made during the first year of the Action is fully reported in the proceedings of the First Workshop on Logical Frameworks, held at Antibes, France in May 1990 and which has now appeared as a book (see below). 
The second workshop, held in May 1991 in Edinburgh, was noticeable for the high number of system implementations that were demonstrated. Major implementation efforts comprise LEGO at University of Edinburgh (Calculus of Extended Constructions), Isabelle at University of Cambridge, Coq at INRIA-Rocquencourt (Calculus of Inductive Constructions), and ALF at Gteborg University (Martin-Lf's framework). These four systems permit interactive developments of proofs with machine assistance. Coq contains a program extractor towards ML. The Paris VII group implemented an executable functional specification language PROPRE. The Sophia-Antipolis group uses CENTAUR to develop a generic interface to theorem provers.

8225;3070;FIDE;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Formally Integrated Data Environment;01/07/1989;30/06/1992;;"The goal of the FIDE Action was to develop the foundations for an integrated data environment through advances in type systems (the expressions used to define the structure and properties of data and to ensure the correctness of programs), programming languages, database systems and conceptual modelling (the process which generates the model of a database application from a real-world description). 
The individual technologies currently supporting application systems are studied to analyse the precise functions they provide. These show both overlap and inconsistency. The Action sought to eliminate the inconsistency and hence make application system building and maintenance much more economic. At the same time FIDE is developing a support architecture which should be significantly more efficient having removed unnecessary and often conflicting overlap. At present the focus is on combining databases and programming languages but the approach is expected to apply to a wider range of components in the system environment.
O2 is an object oriented database system. Its functionalities include that of a database management system (DBMS), a programming language and a programming environment. The target applications are business, transactional, office automation and multimedia applications. It avoids the impedance mismatch between database query languages (like structured query language (SQL)) and programming languages (like C or COBOL). Moreover, the object oriented approach and the integrated programming environment, increase the software productivity.

Information systems are currently supported by a set of loosely connected heterogenous software components, such as databases systems, programming languages, programming environments, etc, with each component designed and built using a specific technology. This research developed a formally defined integration of a full set of technologies to provide a data environment and hence allow a total application to be built within a consistent and seamless integrated environment.

Several type systems suitable for the kernal of an integrated environment have been implemented and are being evaluated. The type checking technology has been developed using a memorizing technique which combines the benefits of name and structural equivalence. A system of incremental binding allows new methods of application construction. A new bulk data type, called maps, has been implemented and is being evaluated. The performance of 2 different map stores has been measured with the SUN 'oodbms' benchmark. A type system statically incorporating both object orientation (inheritance and identity) and relationships has been developed. Comprehensions based on quads have been investigated. The stable store, a prototype canonical object store, already supports 5 languages. One of these, PQuest, is a persistent variant of Quest. This language is being used to investigate the deginition of bulk types, one of 2 experiments into architectures. The other experiment is based on Napier 88. The use of reflection is being investigated.

A new bulk type constructor, map, for database programming languages has been designed. It is designed to balance the requirements for persistent canonical store implementation with the requirements of data modelling. A map value denotes a stored finite updateable function, and may be considered as a set of pairs of tuples, denoting the domain and range respectively. The map includes relations and sets as a degenerate form, when the range is empty, and the map algebra is then equivalent to relational algebra. Utilizing an identified range allows the map to model directed structures such as graphs, which have been explored hitherto in the functional data models. Maps have a user specifiable equality test on domain elements, and a user specifiable stored ordering. A map will trivially represent sets, arrays, sparse arrays, index structures, and relations; hence it is a candidate for a canonical store. Extended to polymorphic maps, it will also represent records, environments and strongly typed memo functions and command histories. Interoperability between various languages is envisaged via such a canonical store. The map construct is sufficiently high level and abstract that it will convey the structural semantics between the interworking components. This same captured structure makes it possible to develop efficient map stores utilizing indexing, clustering and prefetching. Both explicitly controlled operations and an optimizable algebra are defined for maps.

A formalism has been presented for the logical layer of an object oriented query optimizer that subsumes two well known optimization approaches: the Orion technique based on class extensions and the algebra based query rewritings. The formalism also allows easy and exhaustive factorization of common query subexpressions. Furthermore, it uses information on object placement policies and indices to limit the search space for an equivalent expression, thereby reducing the rewriting phase.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach focused on three interrelated topics: 
-programming languages for data-intensive applications 
-object stores with high performance 
-design and construction methodologies 
Six areas of research are investigated to extract essential techniques and fundamental concepts: 
-formal methods in database system and programming language design 
-conceptual models and type systems 
-types for object stores 
-DBPL and persistent programming language design and experience 
-system evolution, type evolution, control of binding and typing 
-operational requirements.

The use of reflect on is being investigated. 
POTENTIAL 
The outcomes of this Action are mainly theoretical, although integration prototypes will be demonstrated. The objective is to provide database programming language designers and programmers with a better understanding of this area. On the one hand, from the outputs of FIDE, designers of database programming languages will be able to identify the adequate type system their language needs and to select the best technology for persistent stores. On the other hand, database application programmers will find the results on conceptual modelling and methodology useful for improving the design of their applications. 
The long-term goal is to specify clear guidelines on the design and architecture of systems which provide as one integrated whole, those facilities currently provided separately by databases and programming languages. At present several interesting demonstration systems exist: Napier 88, DBPL, Galileo, PS-algol and a number of designs for new components and 'total' systems. The longer term workplan would provide complete coverage of the database functions in languages using the latest language technology,integrated with a workbench of tools supporting design, construction, maintenance and operations within the same coherent framework. Within this more ambitious workplan, which goes beyond the original goals of FIDE and will not be completed within FIDE,it would be expected that the integration technology be demonstrated, so that it may be reapplied to industrial systems and other aspects of computer science.";;;;;University of Glasgow;UK;"Università degli Studi di Pisa;UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS;Universität Hamburg;NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF ITALY;Université de Paris XI (Université Paris-Sud);GIP Altair";"IT;UK;DE;FR";

%This objective is in agreement with the European Community strategy: improvement of local treatments of cancer.
The physical and radiobiological characteristics of high energy particle beams as well as the available clinical experience indicate that irradiation of certain tumour types or sites with these beams will improve local control (at present, about 40% of the patients with only localized disease at the time of diagnosis are not cured).

The concerted action has studied the feasibility of a hospital based light ion accelerator facility for the treatment of a large number of cancer patients. In a first part, the socioeconomic aspects, including clinical indications, patient numbers, the operational organization of a large light ion therapy centre, treatment cost and comparison with the actual cost of conventional treatment, have been addressed. In the second part, detailed studies (including cost) of the technical infrastructure have been carried out: design of a superconducting cyclotron, a synchrotron, beam transport and beam splitting, raster and spot scanning beam delivery systems and a variable incidence gantry have been made. Experiments to evaluate radiobiological properties of certain particle types, different beam delivery systems and the use of radioactive accelerated particles for quality control have been undertaken.

The study indicates that up to 3000 patients per year could be treated at 1 light ion accelerator facility at a treatment cost that should not exceed by more than a factor of 2 the cost of comparable conventional radiotherapy.
The feasibility study includes four parts:

1. The accelerator: the aim of this study is to evaluate options based on a superconducting cyclotron or a synchrotron. Considering various elements of the feasibility study and given the foreseeable development of technology, the Project Management Group has opted, after consultation of independent experts, for the synchrotron option.

2. The beam delivery system: two strategies for delivering the dose in the tumour volume, raster scanning or spot (pixel) scanning have been studied. A variable incidence angle system (gantry) has been investigated.

3. An experimental programme including:

- measurements of radio biological properties of carbon, oxygen and neon ions;
- the study of different magnetic beam scanning strategies;
- the production of radioactive ion beams.

3) To describe recent and current activities in the area of DRGs in EC countries within a common scientific framework and with sufficient technical detail, so that all countries might benefit from the experience of others. 
4) To describe plans and needs for future DRG work, and hence to promote the exchange of ideas that might beneficially influence planning decisions at the level of individual EC countries. 
The use of case mix measures has extensively contributed to the knowledge of hospital performance. The spread of diagnosis related groups (DRG) in Europe offers new possibilities for research in this field. The EURODRG project has examined the opportunities for getting comparable DRG hospital statistics in Europe and has produced an overview of DRG used in Europe. Factors introducing difficulties for comparability have been analyzed and agreement on recommendations among experts has been reached. Comparisons of DRG hospital databases from 6 countries have been produced and important differences in length of stay (LOS) for high volume, well defined DRGs have been found, both among countries and among hospitals within countries.
Measurement of the hospital product has been a field of research of significant strategic importance in improving the efficiency of health services. The use of Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) had spread in various European countries during the past decade, offering new possibilities for obtaining information and for comparing hospital operations, at both national and international levels.

Various aspects of new services for distributed design and manufacturing processes were explored. Foundation work involved the development of a model of a manufacturing enterprise and its communications structure, and the elaboration of a number of future manufacturing and communications scenarios. This led to the specificiation of the information bases and interfaces for a future distributed manufacturing environment.

Work then proceeded to 3 practical pilot experiments. In the first, there was the test of the implementation of a communications link between a main contractor and his subcontractor for the exchange of computer aided design (CAD) drawings. The second developed the CHAMADE tool, for the management of design change in a distributed environment, and as a practical exercise was based on the design and order of a lift (elevator). The third, integrating, pilot implemented the Multimedia Industrial LAN (MILAN) demonstrator to show multimedia, transnational group working.

The research has accelerated the development of advanced telecommunications services in the manufacturing area, with evident benefits in efficiency, cost saving and the acceleration of the order design manufacturing cycle. It has also promoted the use of mulimedia communication in an international manufacturing environment, as the means of attaining new levels of business effectiveness.
Technical Approach  

To benefit from advanced telecommunication services in public networks, geographically distributed manufacturing enterprises require applications supporting special features and equipment.  These include eg. short but time-critical messages, non-time-critical transfer of long files (CAD, NC programming) and picture or video information.  For this sector, it is therefore necessary to support both formal and informal communication (person to person) in an integrated IBC network.  

The project has developed a business scenario where strong communication links between geographically separated contractor, subcontractor and service companies is necessary, to optimise utilisation both of manufacturing equipment and design expertise.  During the first phase of work, a study and modelling analysis of new telecommunication services required in distributed manufacturing applications has been carried out.  In the second phase three pilots (local and international) have been established to substantiate the theoretical model and to provide a practical demonstration of how users' needs in manufacturing can be met by the deployment of advanced telecommunication systems.  

Key Issues  

- Cooperation amongst partners in distributed design and manufacturing activities, flexibility in operation and collaboration.  
- Analysis of traffic requirements (critical timing and message priorities).  
- Use of broadband communications in supporting more flexible manufacturing procedures.  
- Demonstration of the special benefits of multi-channel video in resolving manufacturing issues.  
- Ability of the manufacturing enterprise to respond to customer's needs quickly and effectively.  

Achievements  

- Development of a model of an enterprise and its internal and external communications interfaces.  These have been effective in identifying future broadband communication requirements in the manufacturing sector.  
- Development of a number of future manufacturing and communication scenarios.  
- Evaluation of key aspects of these scenarios by simulating them in the pilots ie: SME communications (partnership); asynchronous group working (data and context);  synchronous group working (video for rapport)  
- Specification of information bases and interfaces for a DIMUN environment.  
- EB pilot.  Implementation of a communication link between main contractor and subcontractor for exchange of CAD drawings.  
- KONE pilot.  Development of CHAMADE (change management in distributed environment) that supports transnational group working on order processing.  This was developed using PAGES (programmable agents for group extendible systems) which provides extendible object oriented messaging framework for data and voice mail.  
- BIBA pilot.  Implementation of MILAN (multimedia industrial LAN) demonstrator.  This integrates the object oriented paradigm with the distributed control LAN philosophy to support the concept of multimedia transnational group-working.

8262;3149;MUCOM;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Multisensory Control of Movement;01/07/1989;31/12/1991;;"The MUCOM Action aimed to answer the following questions: 
-On what does the integration of sensory signals depend, considering the multimodal perception of space and movement in natural systems? 
-What is the common frame of reference into which all sensory inputs are translated? 
-How does the brain incorporate the geometric and dynamic properties of motor systems in order to elaborate movement command strategies? 
-Considering the flexibility of the human and animal motor system, what strategies are used to control the execution of movement? 
-How does information on simple motor effectors (such as the eye) compare with information about complex ones (like the head)? And what general principles underly these mechanisms?
Greater understanding is sought of how the brain builds an internal representation of space and movement in order to allow navigation, orientation and action. This objective involves studying the questions of fusion of sensors, sensorimotor coordination, movement perception, posture control and limb movement in biological systems.

The research focussed on 3 areas, navigation, orientation and action, and gave the following results:
measurement of 3-dimensional eye or head movement using magnetic fields;
design and industrial realization of multisensory (visual and vestibular) stimulators;
new histological techniques for marking neurons and the study of really neuronal networks (intracellular and extracellular);
manipulation of visual flow fields (computer displays of visual flow fields for optimizing 3-dimensional motion perception);
algorithms for optimization of multilimb manipulators;
simplifying principles for control 3-dimensional mechanical devices (Listing's law);
new control principles for visiomotor orienting using visual maps with dynamic remapping properties by velocity or position feedback (neurophysiological evidence for existence of feedback in biological systems);
comparative, computer implemented models for active orienting mechanisms;
discovery of the use of extraretinal binocular feedback for the perception of depth;
new results concerning the use of inertial signals for navigation;
basic algorithms underlying visiomotor relations.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Research focused on three areas: 
-Navigation, looking at multisensory interaction in the generation of stabilising eye and head movements, the multisensory detection of head movement, the generation of motor output, and problem-solving strategies. The methods used were behavioural and e lectrophysiological experiments on movement stabilisation, and electrophysiological studies on curvation estimation in navigation trajectories. Theoretical models were also to be constructed. 
-Orientation, which is concerned with multisensory integration, sensorimotor integration and calibration in the control of orienting movements. Investigations were made into: internal target representation and coding of eye position; premotor mechanisms(activity patterns and neuronal connectivity); and sensorimotor transformations. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies of the relevant systems were to be performed. 
-Action, centred on sensorimotor coordination in the control of the human upper limb. This part of the research will address representations of limb configurations, algorithms for limb coordination, and control mechanisms. These aspects were to be invest igated by recording the position of several limb joints via opto-electrical methods and by studies of task execution concerning visuo-manual coordination in humans.

8229;1664;MESH;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Possible Mechanisms for High-Tc Superconductivity and Phenomenological Approaches;01/02/1989;31/07/1991;;"The main problem in the field of high critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is understanding the microscopic mechanisms involved. At present, all the mechanisms proposed involve approximations which are difficult to check. 
The MESH Action aimed to contribute to the resolution of this problem by first analysing existing models and then focusing on the most promising ones. Particular objectives were to: 
-understand the role of strong electron correlation effects in narrow-band materials 
-quantitatively assess the influence of electron-phonon interactions, oxygen deficiency and disorder on superconducting properties 
-understand the phenomenological aspects of the materials concerned.
A thorough theoretical understanding of electron motion in narrow band systems was developed. Electrons in these systems move in a highly correlated way. This leads to unexpected features in their electromagnetic behaviour, the most striking of which is high temperature superconductivity. Understanding this would allow the identification and possibly the control of the mechanisms responsible.

Research in the field of high temperature superconductivity has obtained the following:
calculation of spectroscopic properties of the t-J model (the spin spin dynamical structure factor and the optical absorption in the canted antiferromagnetic phase of this model were calculated and good qualitative agreement with the observed trends in doped antiferromagnets was found);
slave boson studies of the magnetic states of the Hubbard model near half filling, in particular study of the spiral phase;
numerical simultions of the t-J and Heisenberg model (in particular, cluster studies of the t-J model to search for chiral fluctuations);
normal state properties of strongly correlated electrons from the gauge theory point of view (specific predictions for the structure of the de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations);
studies of U(1)-gauge field theory models of superconductivity in 2\1 dimensions.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Systematic studies are being carried out on models of strongly correlated electrons (such as the Hubbard model, the t-J model and their various extensions) with or without incorporation of more traditional aspects (such as lattice vibrations). By a continuous comparison of results obtained in the same model through different techniques, certain models are expected to be eliminated and the search will be narrowed down to those which seem most promising for explaining the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity. In parallel, analytic and computer simulation work will provide a more phenomenological understanding of the electromagnetic and glassy properties of the materials. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
During the second year of this Action the consortium has kept abreast of the state of the art and actively contributed to the new and fast-moving field of high-Tc superconductivity. Among the results obtained are: 
-calculation of spectroscopic properties of the t-J model. The spin-spin dynamical structure factor and the optical absorption in the canted antiferromagnetic phase of this model were calculated and good qualitative agreement with the observed trends indoped antiferromagnets was found. 
-slave-boson studies of the magnetic states of the Hubbard model near half-filling, in particular study of the spiral phase. 
-numerical simulations of the t-J and Heisenberg model. In particular, cluster studies of the t-J model to search for chiral fluctuations. 
-normal state properties of strongly correlated electrons from the gauge theory point of view. Specific predictions for the structure of the de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations. 
-studies of U(1)-gauge field theory models of superconductivity in 2\1 dimensions. Prediction that a large value for the ratio 2 delta (T=0) / kTc (= 7-9) arises naturally in such models. 
POTENTIAL 
This Action tackles very basic and complex problems in solid-state theory which could form the basis for future industrial applications. If the basic pairing mechanism turns out to be electronic, the work will have made a significant contribution to creating a theoretical framework and, eventually, facilitating the future fabrication of improved high-Tc materials. Furthermore, the theoretical mathematical tools that are being developed may also be applicable to quantum chemistry, surface science, and magnetism.";;;;;FORTH RESEARCH CENTER OF CRETE;EL;"UNIVERSITÄT KARLSRUHE;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);Université de Paris XI (Université Paris-Sud);University of Oxford";"DE;FR;UK";

The project aimed to advance the ability to validate knowledge based systems. The objective was to develop a toolbox based on a common representation within which the validation concepts could be defined and analysed.

The research provided a knowledge based system (KBS) project leader with a quality manual that described the related actions to be performed during the whole KBS life cycle, and a toolbox that contained a validation metalanguage (VETA) and validation tools.
The KBS quality assurance and control gathers a set of actions to be done during the whole life cycle. The Quality Manual describes each action in regards to its goals, the validation tools required and the people involved in the action. VETA is a metalanguage that gathers around 1000 primitives dedicated to validation, working on a common conceptual knowledge representation (CCR). This CCR allows support to any KBS that deals with: knowledge representation based on objects and rules, monoinheritance, first order logic, rule set, metarules, etc. The validation tools have been developed within VETA.
7 validation tools cover a wide area of validation problems, ranging from purely practical validation tools to validation problems that are research topics.
The approach was to develop the following methodologies: 

- the definition of a KBS quality manual, with special attention to validation actions during the different phases of KBS life cycles 
- a common conceptual representation (CCR) in which most KBSs can be expressed 
- the definition of a validation metalanguage (VETA) to provide the abstract mechanisms necessary to build validation tools. 

These have provided the basis for several software products:

The objective of this project is to specify, design and test the multifunction integrated circuits necessary to manufacture a low cost smart card based identification system, consisting of a mobile, portable pocket sized smart card reader and a fixed terminal control unit.

2 integrated circuits have been designed in a first version:
a sensitive infrared receiver (SIRR) in bipolar technology;
a wakeup power supply (WUPS) in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The SIRR integrated curcuit (IC) provides a single component receiver, incorporating amplification, filter and gain control functions, coupled to an infrared detector. The WUPSIC provides battery power management (the reader will be activated upon reception of an infrared pulse transmitted by the terminal).

Prototypes of reader and terminal, in the form of a smart card electronic badge and automatic control unit for hands free access control, have been fabricated and tested.

Further work is continuing to improve the power consumption characteristics of the badge, miniaturise it further, and decrease its costs.

Various studies are being executed to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing the system integration level for next generation smart card readers by incorporating the WUPSIC and the microprocessor on the same chip (including the necessary photodiodes) and to see if the infrared sensor diode and the SIRRIC IC can be mounted in the same infrared transparent plastic package with a lens on top.

-develop lateral nanostructures at the state-of-the-art minimum scale (typically 30 nm) 
-study the basic physical properties of the low dimensional nanostructures, both experimentally and theoretically

The fabrication and study of 1-dimensional and 0-dimensional structures has been undertaken. The applicability of nanometre scale technologies to explore the scale limit of both existing and entirely new devices has also been investigated. The study of transport effects at very low temperatures in high magnetic fields and of optical effects at the subpicosecond level have contributed to new concepts and novel devices.

World records have been reached in the nanofabrication of devices: smallest optical wires with good optical properties ever realized, with a 20 nm width, or fabrication of a lateral superlattice with 20 nm dots and 50 nm spacing.

Breakthroughs in transport properties include low dimensional ballistic devices, such as Fabruy-Perot interferometer with electron waves large effects in the conductance statistics of mesoscopic systems, demonstration of granular transport in a single electron transistor like device, and resonant tunelling through quantum wires and dots.

The optical properties of quantum wires have been studied, with the demonstration of 1-dimensional polarization effects, qualitative agreement of the absorption spectra with theoretical calculations, and size dependent carrier relaxation of different materials observed for the first time.
APPROACH AND METHODS

Nanometre-scale structures are being fabricated using high-voltage and high-resolution electron-beam lithography. Focused ion-beam systems enable the localised implantation of dopants into layers and localised etching. Masked implantation techniques are also employed. The formation of Ohmic and Schottky contacts are investigated.

A methodology and a set of integrated support tools are required for this, which it was the objective of the project to develop.
Configuration Programming is an object-based approach to distributed programming. The main principle underlying this approach is that programs should be designed, constructed and modified as a structural configuration of interconnected component instances. Program structure is described by a seperate explicit configuration language, while the components themselves may be programmed in a range of heterogeneous programming languages. This approach is central to the ESPRIT II project, REX, on reconfigurable and extensible parallel and distributed systems. The REX project offers multiple component programming languages to suit the programming task at hand. Similarily, to provide support for diverse application domains, REX supports multiple specification and analysis techniques and the integration of multiple methods. Specification and method integration is provided through the use of a novel approach, called ViewPoints, which supports specification and method partitioning and interaction through explicit transformations analogous to those used in software configurations. Furthermore, a REX Engineering Environment is intended to provide a general facility for integrating information produced during any of the phases of software development and maintenance. It provides an attributed file system combined with language facilities for enveloping and controlling the invocation of slave computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools and compilers. A generalised attribute mechanism is provided to allow specification and design tools to attach information to configuration descriptions. These attributes, which can include timing and behaviour constraints, can be checked during system construction with the aim of ensuring compatibility between components when their interfaces are bound.
The strategy followed is to retain formal specification as the main point for checking system consistency, predicting timing behaviour and assisting in system modifications. The project is developing: 

- a methodology for constructing reconfigurable and extensible distributed and parallel systems 
- tools to support all phases of the distributed application development and maintenance 
- techniques to change running systems and to achieve reliable configuration 
- tools to advise users on how to obtain better performance, based on the separation of the host development and a target operating system. 

The main work areas of REX are: 

- specification of distributed and parallel systems 
- system programming 
- methodology for system development 
- analysis and evaluation 
- dynamic configuration and reconfiguration 
- run-time support 
- demonstrator applications.

The Action was divided into four strands: 
-Meta-issues of program analysis: the foundations of program analysis, addressing non-standard approaches to the meaning (semantics) of symbols in a programming language and the role of type information in program analysis. 
-Methods of program analysis: practical methods, focusing in particular on storage optimisation, parallel programs, and the combination of analyses. 
-Systems and pragmatics: the implementation of results from the first two parts, with the aim of producing prototype Pascal and Haskell systems (Haskell is a novel functional programming language). 
-Program generation: the development of tools for partial evaluation that will combine a program with part of its inputs in order to yield a further program which processes the remaining inputs more efficiently.
Technology has been developed for manufacturing software with minimal human involvement. Research is proceeding into automatic program transformation, semantic analysis and the use of these techniques in the efficient implementation of declarative languages.

Major breakthroughs have been made in the understanding of polymorphic types and their interaction with program analysis, and in unifying existing frameworks.
Prototype systems for storage optimisation and the analysis of communicating sequential process (CSP) programs have been developed and a system, SYNTOX, for the analysis of Pascal and the first prototype compiler for Haskell have been produced.
Better and stronger tools for partial evaluation and other forms of program generation have been developed and installed in an industrial research laboratory; their strength is that they can be applied to themselves, generating compilers and compiler generators. The techniques have been extended to imperative languages, in particular a subset of C.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Three inter-related approaches were pursued: 
1.The development of further methods for automatic program transformation. Partial evaluation has shown great promise in this area: it has already been used to manufacture prototype compilers and compiler generators.  Its power and applicability was impr oved, binding-time analysis investigated, and the method used to manufacture parts of highly optimising compilers. Other automatic optimising transformers were also studied. 
2.The development of  methods for the automated semantic analysis of programs. Work here was based on abstract interpretation, a method which has proved to be widely applicable over the past decade. Its use was extended to new areas and problems, for exa mple the analysis of parallel and logic programs. The intention was to develop efficient analysis algorithms and to find ways to use the more sophisticated understanding of programs that these latest techniques can provide. 
3.The efficient implementation of declarative programming languages. This is a testing ground for the efficiency and power of the methods for analysis and transformation developed in this Action. Work focused on the incorporation of program manipulationmethods into a prototype compiler for the new Haskell language. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Substantial progress was made in all parts of the Action: 
-major breakthroughs have been made in the understanding of polymorphic types and their interaction with program analysis, and in unifying existing frameworks 
-prototype systems for storage optimisation and the analysis of CSP programs have been developed 
-a system, SYNTOX, for the analysis of Pascal and the first prototype compiler for Haskell have been produced 
-better and stronger tools for partial evaluation and other forms of program generation have been produced and one installed in an industrial research laboratory; their strength is that they can be applied to themselves, generating compilers and compiler generators. The techniques have been extended to imperative languages, in particular a subset of C. 
POTENTIAL

The technology of incremental prototyping addresses the development needs of large, distributed and multi-supplier embedded real-time systems.

The concept of incremental prototyping is a way of coping with constantly increasing complexity and risks associated with the industrial development of embedded computer systems. Incremental prototyping technology will address the development needs of large, distributed and multisupplier embedded real time systems.

An incremental prototyping technology for embedded real time systems (IPTES) database or document system has been set up. This system aims to be a standard and could eventually be used by other ESPRIT projects. Project results have been made available to the industry and research communities and a number of articles for international conferences have been produced and published. In addition, dissemination on a local basis has been undertaken. The platform on which the precompetitive IPTES toolset will be implemented has been defined having been chosen after investigating the short term and medium term requirements of such a platform. A preliminary overall design of the IPTES toolset has been made and the design identifies the different tool components and their interconnection and purpose, and specifies and organization of components in layers. Methodological guidelines for the use of Boehm's spiral life cycle model are being developed and the executable models to be supported in the IPTES toolset have been defined. The implementation of IPTES toolset has been initiated with the computation of a first prototype of the IPTES Meta-IV (VDM) interpreter and implementation of the logical model animator has been initiated. The machine level of the IPTES architecture is defined as are the internal execution mechanisms to support the execution of distributed, heterogeneous prototypes. The run time adaptation mechanisms which also enable the execution of models where parts are represented by target code have been defined. Furthermore, the implementation of a run time adaptation system and the development of demonstrator applications have been initiated.

The objective of this project is to develop methods, tools, interfaces and architectures to facilitate the exchange of technical and commercial data between independent organisations working together in manufacturing or distribution chains. The project will be focused on the requirements of the automotive industry. The first stage was to identify the scope and content of the critical issues which must be addressed. This led to the definition and construction of a laboratory model (AS-IS) of a supplier manufacturer distributor chain which reflects the current state of the art. This model will be used to simulate information exchange and transfer in particular areas of investigation. Further stages of the project identified the areas of improvement and entailed the enhancement of the AS-IS model to a FUTURE model. The results of these activities enabled the preparation of requirement specifications for the necessary information system components of the integrated supply and distribution chain. Throughout the analysis phase the project addressed the need for the exchange of neutral data, in terms of both message format and content.
The major benefits envisaged arise from the orientation of the project towards satisfying the needs of the customer and include: decrease in product introduction time, shorter and more reliable delivery lead times, reduced costs, lower stocks, and improved product availability.
Because the computer integrated manufacture for multisupplier operations (CMSO) project is concerned with the improvement of business performance through the application of information technology (IT), there are a number of different aspects to the exploitation of CMSO results: hardware and software products; implementations of methods and products; business and strategic guidance; business cases in support of further research; identification of the business cases for implementation; technical guidance for implementation, training and education; and input to standar ds and other technical and business organisations.

The aim of the research was to demonstrate the application of local and wide area broadband communications within a distributed industrial design and manufacturing system for electronic subassemblies. Key issues in the research included:
modelling, designing and setting up a pilot applicable to virtually all distributed printed circuit board (PCB) computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes;
the determination of the quality of the integrated broadband communication (IBC) services necessary;
analysing security requirements and implementing appropriate security mechanisms;
the determination and provision of the user interfaces required;
the utilization (and integration) of standard document interchange formats;
establishing present limitations of existing networks and (international) interworking capabilities;
preserving optimum portability;
demonstrating the potential managerial efficiency improvements achievable through this application.

Two demonstration models of the application pilot were made available. The early demonstrator was based on broadband technology and served to demonstrate the potential of broadband technology for realizing high quality printed circuit (PC) integrated videoconferencing. The second demosnstration model was based on narrowband technology and provided a low cost solution to PC integrated videoconferencing. As a consequence, virtually all communications technologies are suitable for the system. In addition, the system has been augmented by the most advanced security technology in order to be protected against listening/falsification attacks. These integral security mechanisms are based on advanced chip card technology using encryption/decryPtion by the Ricest-Shamir-AdlemAn (DES) and RSA algorithms.
Technical Approach  

With rapid technological developments having severe cost implications, there is an urgent need to support the decentralisation and geographical distribution of the design and manufacturing processes for integrated circuits, multi-layer printed circuit boards and electronic sub-assemblies.  Geographical separation of design, manufacturing and other tasks requires remote access to data for design, manufacturing and test activities.  In addition, totally new control structures and mechanisms are required to synchronise the distributed design and manufacturing tasks with customer orders.  

The proposed distributed application uses high performance international communication links, such as would be provided by IBC, and demonstrates the integration of video and voice to support interactive CAD-CAM applications.  This will generate substantial bursts of data traffic on a wide area network. Whenever available bandwidth turns out to be a bottle- neck, very advanced data compression techniques will be applied.  This permits the DIDAMES system to also be supported by narrowband communication links, when no broadband communications are available.  

The project also demonstrates the usefulness of international technical and document oriented data interchange standards (such as ODA, STEP) and other international agreements on communications, user interfaces and security issues (such as X-Windows, OSF/Motif, TELETRUST).  

The DIDAMES project ends in February 1992.  

Key issues  
. Modelling, designing and setting-up a pilot applicable to virtually all distributed PCB-CAD/CAM processes.  
. Determination of the quality of IBC services necessary.  
. Analysing security requirements and implementing appropriate security mechanisms.  
. Determination and provision of user interfaces required.  
. Utilisation (and integration) of standard document interchange formats.  
. Establishing present limitations of existing networks and (international) interworking capabilities.  
. Preserving optimum portability.  
. Demonstrating the potential managerial efficiency improvements achievable through this application.  

Achievements  
Two demonstrators of the DIDAMES application pilot have been made available.  The early demonstrator was based on broadband technology and served to demonstrate the potential of broadband technology for realising high- quality PC-integrated videoconferencing.  This was successfully demonstrated at several international fairs and exhibitions, such as the CeBIT fair in Hannover and the SYSTEMS fair in Munich.  

The current demonstrator is based on narrowband technology and provides a low-cost solution to PC- integrated videoconferencing.  As a consequence, virtually all communications technologies are suitable for the DIDAMES system (B-ISDN, ISDN, FDDI, Ethernet, ...).  In addition to this, the DIDAMES system has been augmented by most advanced security technology in order to be protected against listening/falsification attacks.  These integral security mechanisms are based on advanced chip-card technology using encryption/decryption by the DES and RSA algorithms.  

The DIDAMES system is completely application- independent and universally applicable.  Any DOS/UNIX application system, with or without MS-Windows or X- Windows/MOTIF user interface, can be transparently supported.  The system may thus be considered as 'open', with interfaces in compliance with the respective international standards.  The final version, having the complete set of this functionality, will be demonstrated in a multi-point configuration on the CeBIT '92 fair in Hannover, supported by p x 64 kbit/s ISDN connections, where 1<=p<=30.  

Expected Impact  
This project is viewed as an important element in the development of a competitive pan-European electronics industry which makes full use of the community communications infrastructure, also integrating narrowband communications techniques.  It will also test the limitation of the existing wide-area networks and the networking capability of the telecommunications systems of several member states.";;;;;Telematic Services GmbH;DE;"Alcatel ISR;INTRACOM SA;BICC plc;ELBASA;TechnoPlan;ANDUS GmbH;ALCATEL SEL AG;CPV-Stollmann Vertiebs GmbH";"FR;EL;UK;ES;DE";

Technical Approach  

The approach taken divides the work into two complementary parts:  

Analytical part  
. Definition of an overall QoS model, taking into account the life cycle of a service and both user and provider views.  
. Definition of verification methodologies, applicable in the framework of the QoS model, and QoS performance mapping models based on the decomposition of end-to-end services into elements.  
. Application of mapping models to selected case studies: file transfer, HDTV, video conference.  

Practical developments  
. Development of two experimental tool prototypes, exploiting mapping formulas of the analytical work, to derive QoS at both ATM and application levels. Prototype 1 runs in an ATM network simulation environment.  Prototype 2 adds a physical sub-system to Prototype 1, which connects to the user-network interface (UNI) thus allowing live evaluation of QoS, first in demonstrator environments and, later on, in IBC field trials.

In addition to these components - ie connectors, splices and branching devices - low-cost cable termination equipment is being built. 
The overall objective of the project is to develop low cost optimized optical passive components that will build the infrastucture of an evolutionary optical network. The project addresses 3 main aspects:
nonpermanent interconnections;
automated mounting;
branching devices.
Technologies for all products and for the automated mounting process have been assessed. Prototypes of nearly all the components have been produced. Very low cost, but high performance reenterable splices have been produced using moulded plastics. These may be rapidly installed in the field and show an average insertion loss of less than 0.15 dB. 2 complementary multiway products have been developed, 1 using a new connector concept, the other being based on the reenterable splice solution. These components will be used for 2-way to 8-way fibre ribbons or bundles. The single way connector developed within the project and dubbed the EC Connector, has already been introduced to most of the major European telecommunication operators and equipment manufactureres. It is also under standardization within International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and European Electrotechnical Standardisation Organisation Electronic Components Committee (CECC). This low cost push-pull operating connector provides 0.2 dB mean insertion loss and -60 dB maximum reflection features. It may be rapidly installed in the field and is already commercially available. A prototype of an automated connector mounting machine for factory use has also been produced within the project. The EC Connector interfaced active devices have already shoen a reflection free 30% coupling for distributed feedback (DFB) lasers with a far better repeatability than any commercially available solution. The transition from multiway to single way connections is being achieved by the fan-out connector produced within LOOP which can be equipped with optionalmonitoring functions. The fibre based radiating coupler developed is the optimum solution fo r high port count (eg, 64) branching devices. Medium port count (eg, 16) devices are being achieved using integrated optic technology, since this offers the potential of lower losses and costs.
Technical Approach  

To achieve these objectives, a thorough investigation of low-cost, but high-precision technologies is being made.  

The project addresses three main aspects:  

. non-permanent interconnections: eg development of low cost re-enterable splices; connectors; direct fibre connections to active devices; fan-out connectors  
. automated mounting: termination cost reduction is addressed through the development of automated mounting equipment  
. branching devices: development of low cost wavelength independent optical branching components with medium and high port counts.  

Key Issues  
. Realisation of passive components at a viable cost level for inclusion in flexible and transparent networks.  
. Minimisation of termination costs.  

Achievements

In a joint activity with R1030 ACCESS, very low-cost, but high performance re-enterable splices have been produced using moulded plastics.  These may be rapidly installed in the field and show an average insertion loss of less than 0.15 dB.  

Two complementary multiway products have been developed, one using a new connector concept, the other being based on the re-enterable splice solution.  These components will be used for two to eight-way fibre ribbons or bundles.

Technical Approach  

The project will develop new tools, some of which concern usability engineering and are therefore based on a human factors approach.  The project is developing simulation and experimental prototypes on which to carry out human factors experiments into areas identified as critical for the usability of video communications and multimedia retrieval services.  In parallel, user surveys are being planned and conducted to assess user needs and requirements in relation to IBC technology.

The models studied are necessary for automated reasoning at the level of: 
-knowledge representation where knowledge is pervaded with some form of ignorance, be it incompleteness, imprecision or uncertainty 
-inference engines adapted to each form of ignorance. 
The final aim of DRUMS was to attempt the integration of various logics and models into a general model able to cope with the various forms of ignorance, and its implementation in inference engines.

APPROACH AND METHODS 
DRUMS was realised through an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach covering the following four research domains: 
-Logic models for defeasible reasoning, covering default logics, the integration of concurrent representations, and proof procedures and algorithms. 
-Probabilistic models of reasoning under uncertainty and vagueness, addressing the development of possibilistic and linguistic quantifier logics and knowledge elicitation. 
-Models of belief for approximate reasoning, including the transferable belief model, approximations and algorithms, and propagating uncertainty in dependence graphs. 
-Combined models of reasoning with uncertainty, covering an extended logic language and advanced prototyping. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Scientific papers have been published and presented at several congresses. They cover each of the aforementioned domains of research and several integration issues. Six workshops and an International Conference have been organised. Several pieces of software dealing with the management of uncertainty have been successfully developed. 
POTENTIAL 
The improvement of expert system shells on the aspect of uncertainty management is very important for the knowledge-engineering industry. So far, only ad hoc and poorly justified approaches have been available to users, leading to poor results and dissatisfaction. Indeed, for most expert systems developed, the need for uncertainty and incompleteness has not been paramount because of their size and simplicity. As systems become more complex, however, uncertainty and incompleteness become crucial in determining the choices to be made. Furthermore, a proper treatment of uncertainty would improve the behaviour of expert systems.";;;;;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;BE;"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);CENTRE D'ESTUDIS AVANCAIS DE BLANES;UNIVERSITAT DE GRANADA;Université d'Aix-Marseille III (Université de Droit d'Économie et des Sciences);Queen Mary and Westfield College;Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF);Université de Paris XI (Université Paris-Sud)";"FR;ES;UK";

- The general hardware and software architecture for a variety of dedicated IBC terminals.  
- The terminal technology to simultaneously simulate several IBC services in one multi-service connection and make them available simultaneously to the user.  
- Advanced terminal user interface procedures for simultaneous usage of services. 
ITIS has provided a multiservice terminal (MST) demonstrator for simulating broadband services based on a generic architecture of an integrated broadcast communications (IBC) multiservice terminal, and the terminal technology to simulate several IBC services at the same time in 1 multiservice connection and make them available simultaneously to the user. In the demonstrator the following services were supported:
information retrieval and text communication (videotex with alpha-mosaic decoder and photographic decoder);
video telephone;
group 4 telefax;
moving image distribution (television);
moving image retrieval.

The simulation of broadband communications has been done by connection to integrated services digital network (ISDN) networks in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, using gateways between these networks and by using representative simulated IBC services in selected application scenarios.

Several demonstrator hardware and software modules form a basis for further exploitation:
network interface modules supporting ISDN telephone and telefax functions;
a video codec module;
a television and cable network interface for personal computers (PC);
one of the first videotex photographic image decoders;
a display post processor for multiinput image handling;
a software tracing and integration tool;
man machine interface (MMI) prototyping tools.

The demonstrator will allow applications for future communication requirements to run, but from today's viewpoints. This leads to new thoughts on the definition of new broadband services and their application in a real multiservice terminal for IBC.
Technical Approach

8207;3274;FIRST;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Fundamentals of Intelligent Reliable Robot Systems;01/09/1989;29/02/1992;;"The basic aim of the FIRST Action was to integrate components of sensing, planning and control in order to increase the reliability and flexibility of robotic systems. The use of sensors is an essential component of a system that must plan and execute actions intelligently and reliably. Intelligent manipulation must be based on the  relationship between non-local sensing, such as vision and hand-eye coordination, and between local sensing and grasping. Control actions need to be related to task descriptions and the shape representations that support planning. .
The integration of sensing, planning and control in robots was studied in order to further the development of more reliable robotic systems. This involved examining the fundamentals of task planning, geometric reasoning, control, and the use of different sensory modes, such as seeing, grasping and touching. Work has concentrated mainly on vision, and has been most notable for 3 principal advances. Firstly, the development of both algebraic and semidifferential invariants. One important new class of algorithms that will find wide applicability in reliable robotics systems is a technique for computing various forms of symmetry despite perspective distortion. Secondly, techniques for recognition of objects from a database that is essentially constant time. Thirdly, the construction of a graphical symbolic representation of the information in a scene that can support reasoning for assembly.

The most important class of robot motions in future manufacturing and processing applications are constraints. More versatile and higher level specification of constrained (or 'compliant') motions has been introduced. The framework has been used to generate and extend the tracking capabilities of constrained motion controllers. A system has been developed to program robot motions in complex environments automatically. Visual guidance for collision-avoidance is important and has been the subject of collaborative work. An efficient approach for planning the motion of six dof manipulators operating in complex and dynamic environments has been developed. The method is implemented within a computer aided design (CAD) system. Finally, a method of automatic grasp planning for a 2-dimensional articulated hand has been invented. A new capability has been added by work on transitional control between compliant motion and free motion.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Research proceeded on pairwise interactions between sensing, planning and control. This approach is a step beyond work restricted to one or two of  these topics, and is expected to result in more reliable and intelligent systems. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Sensing and planning. Work has concentrated mainly on vision, and has been most notable for four principal advances: (i) the development of both algabraic and semi-differential invariants in joint work between Leuven, Oxford, and Grenoble, leading to an  international meeting on behalf of Esprit and its subsequent publication as a book by MIT Press. One important new class of algorithms that will find wide applicability in reliable robotics systems is a technique for computing various forms of symmetry d espite perspective distortion; (ii) techniques for recognition of objects from a database that is essentially constant time, that is, independent of the size of the database; and (iii) the construction of a graphical symbolic representation of the information in a scene that can support reasoning for assembly. 
-Planning and control. The most important class of robot motions in future manufacturing and processing applications are compliant, in the sense that they must comply with a set of different constraints. For example, positional constraints and force cons traints are applied in grinding, polishing and machining. The Leuven group have introduced the 'feature frame' approach as an extension to the 'compliance frame' or 'task frame' approach for more versatile and higher level specification of constrained (or 'compliant') motions. The framework has been used to generate and extend the 'tracking' capabilities of constrained motion controllers. In collaborations between Karlsruhe and Grenoble, a system has been developed to automatically program robot motions i n complex environments. 
-Sensing and control. Visual guidance for collision-avoidance is an important step towards the sensor guided planning part of First and has been the subject of collaborative work by Karlsruhe, Oxford, Genoa and Grenoble. An efficient approach for plannin g the motion of six dof manipulators operating in complex and dynamic environments has also been developed. The method is implemented within a CAD system. Finally, a method of automatic grasp planning for a two-dimensional articulated hand has been invented.

The facility is to be resident within a user friendly environment accessible throughout the European Community. The project has completed a survey of user needs. The number of responses has been large, clearly indicating a need for reliability prediction tools and for standards in this area. The user needs survey has allowed contacts to be made with European Electrotechnical Standardisation Organisation Electronic Components Committee (CECC) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as well as a number of other standards bodies and interest groups. A survey of existing methods and data has been completed. This has indicated that here is a wide range of opinions about reliability prediction. The survey raised a number of questions about the structure of the database. These questions were resolved in a consensus meeting held within the project. The key issues which have been faced relate to data collection and analysis. One track concentrated on the data itself and analysis methods, the other track considered the software and hardware requirements of the facility.

Technical Approach  

The needs of potential users are being established. Existing data and failure rate prediction methods are being reviewed.  A specification for the data to be collected, analysis tools and presentation to the user is being developed.  Following on from this, the facility will be designed and developed, and tested. The project will collect information of new and existing electronic components, after 'quality checks' this data will be loaded onto the database.  In this phase of the project, data will be gathered on those components that are identified as most required by the user needs survey.  The data will be analysed to produce working reliability estimates for access by users.  

Key Issues

. Availability of data that will allow user needs to be met.  
. Data collection and analysis.  
. Creation of a pan-European component reliability database.

THE PILOT PHASE will involve the specification and implementation of limited demonstrators and the study, using agreed criteria, of the differing applications where telemedicine can be most relevant.
A project was set up to assess the position of and possibilities for telemedicine in Europe both by review of existing work and also development of demonstrator projects in appropriate application areas. These areas were: obstetrics, general medicine, neurology, radiology and nephrology. All five demonstrators operated over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) as this was the only European wide standard network with near universal availability. Obstetrics: the demonstrator project concluded that the telemedicine link approach is feasible and effective. Women are able to make their own recordings without supervision and after only brief training. The system proposed should be as safe as in hospital monitoring. Blood pressure monitoring: 2 devices were tested. It was found that continuous ambulatory monitoring readings were consistently lower than casual readings. Both methods were acceptable to patients, but doctors believed that their workload would be increased by the introduction of such methods. Neurology: electroencephalograms of epileptic patients were recorded at distant sites and analysed to classify the type of disturbance and diagnose the type of epilepsy. The analysis was compared with results from analysis of paper tracer. 92% agreement was achieved on transient analysis and 100% on background analysis, showing that the system is robust enough to be used routinely in clinical practice. Radiology: this demonstrator investigated the feasibility of transmission of medical images for remote inspection by experts in tertiary sites to provide advice to primary as secondary sites. Diagnoses were possible in 55 out of 60 cases using magnetic resonance imaging. Nephrology: informatics and telemedicine were used to take individually optimized treatment to the patient. An on line computer was used to record and analyse patient data trends and adapt treatment regimes accordingly. 

The desirability and applicability of telemedicine have been confirmed. Guidelines have been given to maximize the potential of new telemedicine products.
The tasks will include : 
1. Studying the existing opportunities and requirements for telemedicine and constructing models of the current medical processes for the demonstrators in this project. 
2. Performing a Quality of Care and Cost Analysis of the benefits of various telemedicine strategies. 
3. Investigating the requirements and standards for telemedicine, including medico-legal implications. 
4. Implementing the limited demonstrators of the project to illustrate the value of telemedicine in previously selected medical areas in five different countries. 
5. Proposing tasks for future work and specifying demonstrator(s) for the main phase, which will best enable the benefits of telemedicine to be illustrated in a total clinical service context. 
THE MAIN PHASE will implement and evaluate a general purpose telemedicine system, capable of dealing with a variety of different types of sensors, signals ans systems, and passing the captured, processed and unprocessed data, to an appropriate site where it is automatically further processed, acted upon by an expert system and stored in databases. 
Important aspects of this project are the recommendation of a set of standards, applicable to the acquisition, processing and transmission of information in telemedicine ; and the specification of the distributed electronic multimedia medical record ready for transfer to the IBC environment.

The aim of the project is to extend the state of the art in speech recognition and to place this innovative technology in adverse environments such as car and factory floor. Starting from an established base of expertise, this project involves theoretical work on algorithms and the development of hardware prototypes. To get the best recognition performance, algorithms covering the different aspects of signal processing were considered. The activities were subdivided into 6 work packages concerning respectively system definition and standards, transducers and noise reduction, feature extraction, pattern processing, human factors and user interface, system prototyping and evaluation. After a brief presentation of the general structure of the project (objectives, organisation, participation, resources), this paper presents the state of the work after two years.

The objective of adverse environment recognition of speech (ARS) project was to develop improved algorithms for speech recognition in the presence of noise and to build a real time demonstrator. The demonstrator was to incorporate an isolated word noise robust recognizer, verify algorithm performance, and address the problem of speech based person machine dialogue as a system interface in practical applications.

The application environment chosen was the car. The system has a 100 word vocabulary, chosen by each national group of partners and tailored to the specific application environment. Advances were made in:
reduction, by signal preprocessing, of the effects of noise on speech signals;
feature extraction, to improve noise robustness;
study and refinement of algorithms for speech pattern matching in noisy environments;
speaker adaptation;
dynamic system adjustment to user feedback and the development of error correction strategies in the human interface;
development of system prototypes (hardware and firmware) for real time speech recognition.

The real time demonstrator was based on a general purpose digital signal processing (DSP) chip attached to a personal computer or a stand alone system. A multilingual database collected in noisy environments was made available and used for the evaluation of baseline systems. These were realized according to a common standard suitable for exchanging the software modules of the algorithms. Various algorithms were developed and evaluated and a set of algorithms for the final prototype were selected. A human machine interface concept was defined and the porting of the various models to the target system hardware was initiated.
The complete chain of processing has been initiated on a real time hardware; 2 demonstrators have been installed inside cars for assessment of their performance in real operating conditions.
The requirements included a 100-word vocabulary, chosen for each language group of partners and tailored to the specific application environment. Advances were needed in terms of:

Research has been carried out with respect to making transmitted data secure. This involved devising legally binding procedures for the execution of data exchange transactions.

These procedures enable the user and the terminal in question to be identified, to test access authorization and to prevent the falsification of data. Once defined, these procedures can also be used to safeguard the transmission of control data of the integrated broadcast communications (IBC) operator.

The research addressed some specific objectives involving the development of possible integrity concepts in IBC services, cost and performance and definition of a feasible global integrity system, taking into consideration in particular: peer entity authentication, digital signature, anonymity, proof of origin and receipt, access control, data integrity, integrity management.

As result of the theoretical work carried out 9 deliverables have been finalized. A security threat model for the IBC was outlined, descriptions of integrity mechanism and required formalisms presented and references made to related standardization activities. Results of the integrity mechanisms investigation, evaluation and classification together with the study of the relevant characteristics for solutions for integrity services were documented.
A set of conclusions related to integrity policy and integrity management were elaborated upon and a global integrity system aiming at providing guidelines for the IBC was proposed in order to support integrity services for every application available.

These procedures must enable the user and the terminal in question to be identified, to test access authorisation and to prevent the falsification of data.  They must be so clearly defined and secure that the scope of these procedures cannot be contested.  Once defined, these procedures can also be used to safeguard the transmission of control data of the IBC operator.  

During 2 years, this project has been able to address some specific objectives:  

- development of possible integrity concepts in IBC services  
- cost and performance  
- definition of a feasible global integrity system, taking into consideration in particular: peer entity authentication, digital signature, anonymity, proof of origin and receipt, access control, data integrity, integrity management.  

Nine deliverables have been finalised as result of the theoretical work carried out.  Deliverable 1 and 2 are devoted to the determination of the IBC integrity needs and research for integrity mechanisms.  Deliverable 7 expands this last item.  A security threat model for the IBC was outlined, descriptions of integrity mechanism and required formalisms presented and references made to related standardisation activities.  Results of the integrity mechanisms investigation, evaluation and classification together with the study of the relevant characteristics for solutions for integrity services are documented in deliverables 3, 4, 5 and 6.  

The project elaborated a set of conclusions related to integrity policy (deliverable 6) and integrity management (deliverable 9) and proposed a global integrity system aiming at providing guidelines for the IBC in order to support integrity services for every application available (deliverable 10).";;;;;ANT Nachrichtentechnik GmbH;DE;"Sagem SA;SIEMENS AG;Philips USFA;Thomson CSF";"FR;DE;NL";
3606;STEP0111;MERGE;;FP2-STEP;;FP2;Modelling and experimental research into gas explosions;01/06/1991;31/07/1993;;"To provide a consistent set of data to validate predictive techniques and to improve phenomenological models to predict the effects of explosion. 

It has been established that damaging overpressures can be generated only by flammable vapour clouds burning in congested areas. 

There are still large gaps in our knowledge on vapour cloud explosions. Considering, for example, the jet release of a flammable gas from a pressurized pipe or vessel. The turbulence due to the jet release will enhance the combustion rate if this jet is ignited. The influence of various parameters such as the location and time of ignition, the release rate and scale are unknown. Although both computer codes and physical modelling experiments are currently used as predictive tools, these predictive techniques have never been compared against a consistent set of data at different scales, with different fuels and different obstruction parameters. Furthermore, the way that combustion has been modelled in the numerical techniques is very basic and probably needs further improvement. 

There are 3 main work programmes as follows. 
Generation of experimental data concerning the effect of obstructed regions on flame propagation.  Large, medium and small scale experiments will be undertaken using different fuels comparing a wide range of venting with obstacles of different blockage blast pressure and flame speed will be monitored. 
Generation of experimental data to quantify the effect on flame propagation of the turbulence generated by a jet release.  Experiments will be performed to quantify the effects of explosion of flammable vapour clouds during discharge from a pressurised vessel or pipeline. 
3) Development of combustion models.  It is proposed to develop a turbulent reaction model incorporating reduced reaction mechanisms and a probability distribution function(PDF) transport equation model.";;;;CSC;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO*;NL;"Telemark Innovation Centre;British Gas plc;CHRISTIAN MICHELSEN RESEARCH AS;Battelle-Institut eV;IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;INSTITUT NATIONAL DE L'ENVIRONNEMENT INDUSTRIEL ET DES RISQUES;Shell Research Ltd";"NO;UK;DE;FR";

This environment will be designed to meet the needs of a number of specified applications selected for their diversity and economic importance, and will be evaluated by reimplementing 2 of these as demonstrators.

Requirements for time dependent reasoning (TDR) applications have been identified and analysed through numerous industrial case studies (aviation, railways, urban traffic control, failure detection and analysis, production planning, monitoring, etc).
A general representation formalism (GRF) for TDR applications based on event calculus has been specified, as well as a common representation language (CRL). Both GRF and CRL have been validated using the case studies.
The architecture and basic tools of the development platform for time dependent reasoning applications are now complete, and the work focuses on the evaluation through the development of test cases in air traffic control, urban traffic control and telecommunications network diagnosis.

The most important contribution to the underwater noise level is due to the noise generated by the ship traffic. 
The scientific approach to practical application for the estimation of underwater acoustic ship traffic noise has been adopted. The rationale of the project can be outlined as follows: definition and identification of source parameters; single and multiple ship traffic mathematical modelling identification; acoustic radiation and propagation modelling; signal and noise processing characterization with gaussian and nongaussian hypotheses; recognition and classification of ship acoustic emissions.
The project will be developed in several parts: 
-        study and characterisation of the source of the noise and the radiation mechanism in the surroundings of a set of transiting ships; 
-        the propagation of such a noise in the environment of coastal waters, by using propagation models; 
-        statistical characterisation of the shipping noise;

The study is focused on 3 specific objectives: 

Elaboration of acoustic fatigue strength data for advanced materials. 
Development of semi-empirical models of acoustic loads and correlation between flight conditions and acoustic tests (testing strategy). 
Computational calculation of the dynamic response and application of models of fracture mechanics to predict the life duration.
It has been found that the use of a frequency degradation criterion, usually applied to classical metallic materials and early carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials, is not suitable as the only parameter, for determination of CFRP specimen failure in acoustic fatigue. A suitable criterion should be based upon the degradation of the mechanical properties of the specimens.

It has been shown that the excitation of structures by aero-acoustic loads may not be simulated fully in progressive wave tube (PWT) by simply modifying and correctly shaping the spectral content. The effect of the spatial distribution of the loading was clearly different in both cases and the tested specimen endurance might be significantly different. A theoretical approach based on correctly predicting responses to both types of environment is required.
The work comprises: 
Preparatory investigation for the acoustic fatigue tests: definition of the test specimens and test conditions. 

Dynamic tests by shaker excitation in order to determine random vibration strength data for advanced metallic and composite materials: 
S-N curves (stress endurance data); 
dA/dN curves (damage growth rate data). 

Acoustic tests in a wind tunnel and progressive Wave Tubes: 
to validate aero-acoustic loads in a wind tunnel; 
to calibrate tests in Progressive Wave Tube (PWT) by comparison of the structural response between wind tunnel tests and PWT tests. 
to get response parameters for comparison with predictions; 
to get acoustic fatigue strength data.

8251;3207;FP4-ACTS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;High-Resolution Speech Recognition : Auditory Connectionist Technologies for Speech;01/07/1989;31/03/1992;;"The key research questions explored were: 
-How can auditory processing performed in the cochlea be simulated? 
-How can the transient information concerning the onsets and offsets of parts of speech be extracted from an early stage of the auditory processing chain? 
-How can existing connectionist recognisers be developed to perform vowel recognition using the cochlea simulation as a front-end ? 
-How can training techniques for connectionist recognisers be improved? 
-How do humans perform on a phoneme recognition task in the absence of lexical and contextual constraints?
The computer modelling of auditory processing and connectionist systems for speech recognition was addressed. Based on research into peripheral auditory processing and cognitive research on speech perception and memory, the primary goal was to develop a recognition system that benefits from the processing embodied in current models of the human auditory system.

At the present time, developed software and published research on the project include:
an efficient computer simulation of cochlea processing, documentation of the software for users in speech recognition and hearing research and published papers describing experiments on octave perception and phoneme recognition;
efficient implementation of a connectionist recognizer producing performance comparable to the best fast Fourier transform (FET) filterbank and improved training and pattern recognition algorithms;
experimental research on the structure of human phonological memory.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The goal was to construct a recognition system involving a high-resolution front-end processor based on current models of the human auditory system, and  a word-recognition system based on abstract phonological representations and a phonological buffer store. 
The three parallel research streams aimed to: 
-Develop a detailed but efficient functional model of human hearing in five stages: spectral analysis, neural transduction, phase allignment, pitch extraction and timbre stabilisation. Feature extraction mechanisms used in the model were to be developedin line with psychological research. 
-Compare connectionist recogniser performance using auditory preprocessing with conventional spectrographic preprocessing. 
-Develop new recogniser architectures and training algorithms in line with psycholinguistic research. 
Work was also directed towards developing user documentation for the cochlea simulation software, establishing base-line performance for phoneme recognition using both traditional and auditory front-ends, feature extraction software, and an efficient parallel implementation of a connectionist recogniser. Phonological memory research, experimentation concerning human vowel recognition and human psycho-acoustical research are continuing parts of the Action. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
At the present time, developed software and published research on the Action include: 
-An efficient computer simulation of cochlea processing; documentation of the software for users in speech recognition and hearing research; published papers describing experiments on octave perception and phoneme recognition. 
-Efficient implementation of a connectionist recogniser producing performance comparable to the best HMM recognisers; comparisons of the auditory model front-end with an FFT filterbank; improved training and pattern-recognition algorithms. 
-Experimental research on the structure of human phonological memory.

The following techniques and capabilities were developed: 
a gateway to connect the public primary rate ISDN (PRI) to existing Ethernet local area networks (LANs); 
a very efficient inverse multiplexer capability conforming to the BONDING standard to aggregate high bandwidth across the integrated services digital network (ISDN) by combining a number of discrete 64 Kbit/s calls and compensating for unequal cross network propagation delays; 
experiments with home working, using dial up workstation to LAN connection across the public ISDN. These showed that circumstances exist where, by adopting suitable automatic disconnection and reconnection strategies, near LAN performance can be achieved across the ISDN at a significant saving over medium distance commuting costs; 
a flexible PRI common channel signalling protocol converter interfacing between the Euro-ISDN 1.421 protocol and others such as the UK DASS 2 standard; 
a channel groomer capable of sharing a single PRI access between a number of diverse, concurrently operating, ISDN equipments; 
open systems interconnection (OSI) management, management information bases (MIB) for X.400 mail and X.500 directory services; 
integration of security and X.500 directory services, with remote authentication across X.25 and ISDN networks; 
integration of these services within a comprehensive OSI management system.
The final demonstration would show applications running over OSI protocol stacks supported on workstations and servers directly attached both to LANs and to a digital PABX. High performance LAN interconnect would be shown with gateways operating between LANs and Primary Rate ISDN (PRI) on the PBX. 

As the project evolved further objectives were added including some evaluation of true WAN usage and home working - the original ISDN PBX was replaced by use of switched Public ISDN connections, including Basic Rate (BRI) as well as PRI. New applications included multimedia and high quality video using an 'inverse multiplexer' to aggregate sufficient ISDN bandwidth.";;;;;3 NET Ltd;UK;"System Wizards Srl;Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG;Birkbeck College, University of London";"IT;DE;UK";

The project was to be jointly executed by three contractors, TNO (NL), KfK (D) and NRPB (UK) and it was to run initially for two years from January 1988. The purpose of the contract was to develop a computer system which could aid decisions on countermeasures following a radiological emergency. 

As a result of the contract a prototype computer program has been written which helps a decision-maker to structure the problem and investigate the consequences of and possible bases for, different countermeasure strategies. In order to demonstrate the potential of this decision tool, some illustrative applications were developed, which explored its use for decisions on the countermeasures of relocation and food interdiction. The prototype and a copy of the final report are available for organizations actively involved in research related to the RADE-AID project. The present contract is a continuation of the first RADE-AID contract. The computer system will be further developed with particular reference to the user interface, the decision logic, the database of model predictions supplied for use with the system and in consultation with decision-makers. In addition to providing assistance to a decision-maker following an accident, it is intended that this system could be used in the development of emergency  lans and as a tool for assisting in the training of those with responsibility for managing the response of accidents. 
The radiological accident decision aiding computer system, RADE-AID, is under further development with particular reference to the user interface, the decision logic and a database of model predictions supplied for use with the system. As part of the decision aiding system, an expert system shell has been developed. To develop the structure and content of the rules to be implemented into the system, several meetings with German experts involved in decision making have been organized. Based on case studies with different release characteristics, countermeasure strategies, environmental situations, and the corresponding spectrum of consequences precalculated by the program package COSYMA, various questions and problems were discussed for prerelease and release conditions such as:
principle rules of emergency response;
relevance of different consequence types and quantities in the decision process (doses and/or health effects, economic impact);
the availability of technical equipment and manpower;
the size of areas with sheltering and evacuation and the timing of these actions including the behaviour of the population;
and the role of existing recommendations and emergency plans.
From these meetings, a fundamental rule structure could be identified.

Example sets of preference functions and weighting factors been generated without input from the decision maker side and integrated in the form of separate routines into the rule structure of the expert system. Thus, a combination of a rule based system with multiattribute value theory resulted which allows exploration of the interaction between both methods and their potential application in computerized real time decision support systems.

In the development of a radiological accident decision aiding system, RADE-AID, 2 versions of the decsion aidingsoftware are being developed, namely DATUM and DATARADE. DATUM is a multiattribute analysis tool for general applicability while DATARADE is the version of DATUM for radiological applications. Initial contacts have been made with 3 organisations in the United Kingdom, who have responsibility for decision making in a radiological protection context, in order to explore ways in which the software could be tailored more closely to their needs, in terms of the presentation of information, functionality provided and ease of use.

The radiological database for the DATARADE software has been designed, together with the necessary interface to the decision aiding software. Existing accident consequence models have been adapted to predict the long term radiological, economic and social consequences of notional United Kingdom accidents occurring in different weather conditions. The full database will contain information on the consequences of adopting a range of relocation and food interdiction strategies. A limited version of the database has been developed based on the results for a range of relocation strategies. More data is required to expand the relocation database for application to the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany. Currently the use of data interpolation procedures are being explored in order to limit the eventual size of the database.";;;;CSC;Business Unit of TNO Built Environment and Geosciences;NL;"NATIONAL RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION BOARD;Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Technik und Umwelt GmbH";"UK;DE";

The project was aimed to assure optimum conditions of industrial burning systems through the maintenance of efficient flame characteristics, which are achieved with the implementation of adequate control mechanisms in 2 different levels. Low level control aims at the definition of simplified dynamic models and proper control strategies and includes sensor integration and the implementation and optimization of new sensors, either physical and chemical or optical.

Other sensors under development included viscosity meters for heavy fuel oil and molten glass and a volumetric fuel flowmeter for fuel oil.
High level control aims at the definition and implementation of actions based on: sensorial information, specific knowledge driven by sophisticated mathematical models of the flow and heat transfer characteristics of industrial burning systems and empirical knowledge of subsystem not considered by the mathematical models.
The AIMBURN project was essentially industry driven, but the progress of the work revealed a scientific potential which was partially exploited. Considerable innovative and original work include: use of computer vision for flame classification, experimental characterization of turbulent flames in mutual interaction, numerical simulation of turbulent flame images, implementation of furnace control strategies based on physically derived models, sensor development for molten glass and heavy fuel oil viscosity, dedicated hardware integrating recently produced digital signal processing (DSP) chips in purpose built architectures, development of physical submodels to predict nitrogen oxide emissions from industrial combustion environments, application of expert systems to real time processes, and standardization of procedures for knowledge acquisition in continuous plants.
The impetus for the work stems from the fact that industrial competitiveness within the European Community over the next decade will undoubtedly depend on the efficient use of information technologies to optimise energy consumption. Since energy consumption and pollution are frequently linked, the implications for pollution abatement may have also to be considered in the application of IT to improve industrial competitiveness. The project is aimed to assure optimum conditions of industrial burning systems through the maintenance of efficient flame characteristics, which are achieved with the implementation of adequate control mechanisms in two different levels, as follows:

Integrated design programming system (IDPS) gathers five European application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) suppliers and three system houses to define an advanced ASIC service, based on common concepts, libraries and design methodologies. Using the IDPS approach will give European customers the opportunity to do portable designs, manufacturable by any of the five IDPS vendors. IDPS design methodology is based on a top down approach, using very high speed computer hardware description language (VHDL) and synthesis tools. IDPS digital library is structured in three levels: SystemLib, MacroLib and CoreLib and completed by a family of regular array generators. The only technology dependent parts of the Library are CoreLib and Generator Leaf cells (primitives). These parts will be optimised to each vendor's process for the best performance compromise. This paper presents the main concepts which form the backbone of IDPS, in the field of standards, library structure, generator concepts, process issues and design methodology.
Following the completion of the first or definition phase of IDPS (projects 2270 and 2426), the second phase has now been completed. 

Phases 2 and 3 of the project focus on sub-micron processes with 0.7/0.8 micron feature sizes which were available in time for commercial exploitation of the first IDPS results in the second half of 1992. 

The key objectives set at the start of IDPS were: 

- standardisation, leading to a European industry standard 
- a 'Common Library', recognised as a European multi-source library 
- implementation of the library in the 0.7/0.8 micron processes 
- several CAD systems capable of reliable, error-free design of high complexity (1 - 2 million transistor) ASICs 
- to ensure semi-second sourcing of circuits designed with the common library, and full second sourcing between groups of the vendor partners (subject to business agreements). 
- short turnaround time to prototypes and 'right-first-time' designs and prototypes. 

Demonstration and Exploitation 

The practical usefulness of the library, CAD and prototyping services will be shown by the IDPS demonstrators and test chips. User partners are orienting their demonstrators to products in their application areas. The vendor partners have shown examples of early exploitation of the results. In addition the vendors demonstrated netlist compatibility by each designing (ie, lay-out implementation and simulation) the same representative ASIC circuit example. 

The complexity of ASICs has increased during the period of the IDPS project. The IDPS library and tools themselves allow the development of ASICs with a complexity of 1 to 2 million transistors. The design of a demonstrator of this complexity has started in year 3. Exploitation of IDPS results in the 0.7/0.8 micron process started in the second half of 1992, and improvements in turnaround time have been reported. 

Exploitation has been demonstrated in 1993 by all partners. ES2 has accepted the responsibility to make the results available to small-volume ASIC customers.

Technical Approach  

Following a radical change of emphasis late in 1991 the demonstrator is being constructed as two separate sub- systems, each realising the elements of terminal(s), customer premises network (CPN), customer access connection (CAC) and broadband switch.  One sub-system addresses the broadcasters studio environment, whilst the second caters primarily for the domestic environment.  The sub-systems will be integrated together with additional equipment, to form the final demonstrator during the first quarter of 1993.  

Key Issues  
. Establishment of common TB specification  

Provision of broadband signalling capability which supports 'service component' concepts  
. Support for a representative sub-set of services  
. Testing and evaluation  

Achievements  
Outline plans for the demonstrator and system designs for the sub-systems and the final demonstrator were established.  The requirements of additional equipment especially in the signalling and control areas have also been defined, and a major achievement has been the production of an agreed specification for the interface at the TB reference point which will be used by the project.  This specification is based on R1044/UNI, CFS and CCITT definitions, but has been enhanced to make it implementable and to include support for the use of service components.  

Work on test specifications and test cases for each network element and complete sub-systems is well advanced.  Requirements and plans for the site of the final demonstrator at the Research Neher Laboratories of the Netherlands PTT, in Leidschendam, have been established.  

The work has led to one published paper, although input to standardisation bodies has been via liaison with R1044/UNI.  

Expected Impact  
The project will contribute to the development and adoption of an agreed BUNI specification in Europe, and will provide a practical vehicle on which, IBC system design concepts can be explored, and IBC testing tools can be developed.  Furthermore, the demonstrator will act as a very tangible example of the results of European cooperation, and the achievements of the RACE programme.";;;;;British Telecom plc (BT);UK;"Metra Corporation;Ascomtech AG / Hasler;Società Italiana Telecomunicazioni SpA;PTT Nederlans Research;Electronik Centralen;Clemessy SA;GPT Ltd;SIEMENS AG;AT&T Network Systems Nederland BV;Telettra Espanola SA;MARI Applied Technologies Ltd;BEO Communications GmbH;ALCATEL SEL AG;British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC);Thomson CSF;Cellware Breitband Technologie GmbH";"FI;CH;IT;NL;DK;FR;UK;DE;ES";

The project will establish a design and analysis tool for complex mechanical systems combining technologies such as the Finite Element Method, dynamic analysis of flexible mechanisms and control system models. 

The design tool will be based on existing commercial software, and new functionality will be specified by the application partners in the project. 

The simultaneous simulation and result processing by utilising the latest high performance computer technology will partly replace the traditional separate result postprocessing. This will enable the user to supervise the simulation in a multi-window graphical environment and interrupt or communicate with the simulation as it proceeds. Simulation of aspects of product behaviour will be made with a precision which has hitherto been impossible to model. 

The project will extend the results of several ESPRIT projects, particularly numbers 322 (CAD*I), 1561 (SACODY), 2195 (CADEX) and 2614 (NIRO). 

Standard formats and protocols (eg STEP) will be used wherever possible and the system will be open-ended for the easy exchange of modules. STEP formats will be described so that all data exchange can take place with the help of the STEP formatter. 

The tool will employ parallel processing techniques, based on substructuring, and may require optimisation on supercomputers. 

The project will concentrate on: 
- implementation, option and functionality requirements 
- multi-disciplinary dynamic simulation and optimisation 
- user environments 
- simulation and optimisation of tool applications in flexible structures in robot, aerospace, offshore, windmill and crane systems.";;;;;DANSK TEKNOLOGISK INSTITUT;DK;"Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Technik und Umwelt GmbH;SINTEF PRODUCTION ENGINEERING;DET NORSKE VERITAS;Syntax Factory Automation SpA;ABB ROBOTICS PRODUCTS AB;Dornier System GmbH;Femview Ltd;NORSK FORSVARSTEKNOLOGI";"DE;NO;IT;SE;UK";

Furthermore, it should provide better performances and larger storage management, and thus enhance overall system performance. 

The PREJEEMI project aimed at defining the DSS in terms of technical characteristics to match the required market needs; consequently, it will also cover the definition of the 'cahier des charges'.

These communications involve the railway operator's requirements, railway services offered to passengers, and passenger services such as telephone or mobile office services.
The objective of the European railways in house network (ERWIN) exploratory action was to investigate the domain of fixed to mobile communications with particular emphasis on ground to train communications. These communications involve the railway operator's requirements, railway services offered to passengers, and passenger services such as telephone or mobile office services. 3 communication segments have been investigated:
the on board segment (communications aboard a train);
the ground to train segment (the 'hop' between the moving platform and fixed equipment);
the ground segment (communication between the ground end of the ground to train segment and railway control centres or gateways to public networks).

2 applications account for the bulk of the demand for on board services and track side communications: train control and passenger telephone services. For the on board segment, wire vehicle highways with fibre and wire train highways are thought to be the best architectures in the near term. For the ground to train segment, there was a strong wish to use an existing system. The most promising candidates appeared to be TETRA (only data services and speech transmission offered) and GSM (telephone services offered also). There are, however, technical problems to be overcome, and alternative solutions have therefore been investigated. An attractive one is a radio link with a modulation and equalising scheme. Another appealing avenue has been identified as the emerging short-range micrograph communication technology. Yet another solution, of interest on low-traffic routes would be basedon a coming generation or low orbit communications satellites. For ground communications, the workability of a number of longer distance local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN) in a railway environment have been assessed. However current drop and insert punched card machine (PCM) technology may suffice for most if not all ground communications requireme nts.

Critical communications have to be carried along with less critical ones, which may give rise to conflicting requirements. 2 interesting approaches have been identified. Static scheduling analysis is applicable when resources access needs are known in advance: this is the case of most embedded systems, such as train control. Dynamic scheduling analysis is applicable where resource access needs cannot be precisely determined: this is the case of most open systems, such as passenger services.
Three communication segments have been investigated: 

- the on-board segment, which focuses on communications aboard a train, viewed as a mobile and reconfigurable platform 
- the ground-to-train segment, which deals with the 'hop' between the moving platform and fixed equipment such as radio base-stations; 
- the ground segment, which focuses on communication between the ground end of the ground-to-train segment and railway control centres or gateways to public networks. 

While the basic ground-to-train services involve all three segments, it has seemed appropriate to also consider services that will only use one of them, namely purely on-board services and track-side communications.";;;;;Community of European Railways;FR;"SECRE/SOCIETE D'ETUDES ET RECHERCHES;Telettra SpA;ENA TELECOMUNICACIONES;ASCOM-AUTOPHON;Siemens Plessey Controls Ltd;TRIALOG INFORMATIQUE";"FR;IT;ES;UK";

The software SYNEP is concerned with the process energy integration and the synthesis of optimal heat exchanger network, and the software EMS has been developed to solve the optimal management of utility systems. Both systems have been further developed, to strengthen the methods to solve industrial problems and the addition of new capabilities.

Development of SYNEP includes:
the targeting using restricted matches, which allows the energy target to be set, taking into account forbidden matches, and the calculation of minimum energy cost penalty associated;
the optimal utility system integration including the mechanical power requirements;
the introduction of heuristic rules to increase the efficiency of the heat load distribution calculation.

The main developments of EMS are:
unit initialization procedure which allows the interactive setting of temporary specifications on a unit to calculate the unit;
reverse flow valve model which allows the calculation of the inversion of flow through a valve and the associated pressure drop (this model allows the calculation of highly interconnected headers);
data files allowing easy data exchange with other software, like data reconciliation and spreadsheets;
the use of physical units other than SI.
This work is a continuation of a previous contract EN3E-0136-B which resulted in two models: SYNEP1 which simulates the energy utilisation of chemical processes and optimizes heat exchanger networks: SYNEP2 which optimizes the management of utility networks. In this project, the two models are further improved and applied to existing installations. Three tasks are foreseen. 

To develop new techniques and new possibilities for the SYNEP codes. Improvements in SYNEP1 allow a more precise definition of the problems which have to be resolved. Economic, feasibility, flexibility, security, environmental, start-up and other aspects are incorporated in the model. The operator's experience will also be introduced. Connections are indicated as: forbidden, free, favourable, obligatory, etc. SYNEP2 is applied to gas turbines, where slow rolling of turbines, the standby state for boilers, the thermal losses on the headers and the heat balance are simulated. Automatic links between existing BELSIM-VALI and SYNEP2 are developed. 

A second task is to draft user friendly manuals for use of the SYNEP models in industry. 

Finally, SYNEP1 and SYNEP2 are evaluated with data from manufacturers (i.e. LOR and MOTOR OIL from the oil industry; KEMIRA from the fertilizer industry).

-Develop analytical and numerical models of neural-type networks that will allow optoelectronic devices to be specified for their implementation. 
-Study the properties of the various state-of-the-art optoelectronic devices, particularly those based on III-V multiple quantum well (MQW) materials, oriented towards their use in neural network applications. 
-Study the technologies for integrating such processing devices with silicon electronic processing elements.

New nonlinear optical properties have also been observed and collaborative studies of new techniques for integrating such devices with electronic circuits for use in interconnects have been carried out.

Novel optical implementations of neural type networks have been demonstrated and advances have been made in the understanding of the relationship between neural and conventional associative memories that point to new ways in which 'optical learning' might be implemented. These have been tested by numerical simulation.

8205;1656;IDEAL;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Interactive Dialogues for Explanation and Learning;01/10/1989;30/09/1992;;"The key topics being researched : 
-a theory of explanation which embraces description of different types of explanation, a generic model of the explanation process in terms of action for information seeking and knowledge transfer, and explanatory discourse. 
-knowledge representation for task based explanation and retrieval processes to satisfy user requests. 
-how user requests for information are analysed in a conversational context of discourse focus, functional analysis of question types, and generation of appropriate answers. 
-the development of discourse models for planning contextually appropriate control of human computer interaction in explanation systems.
A unifying framework of dialogue models for explanation and learning was developed. The 3 main research themes were: thetheoretical study of discourse for conversational control in didactic situations; the experimental study of optimal explanatory strategies and media; and the creation of a computational architecture of models and processes to retrieve domain knowledge and control explanatory conversations.

Considerable empirical work has been completed in the analysis of a corpus of explanation dialogues for linguistic features, information provision and explanation strategies. Experimental studies have provided further understanding about the effect of expert style on the quality and effectiveness of explanations. An initial theory of explanation has been developed which considers the ontology, viewpoints and criteria for successful explanation. Planning models describe the process of the explanatory task incorporating strategies for explanation delivery and selection rules for generating appropriate content. The theory of task knowledge structures has been extended to provide a domain knowledge model to support explanation. Experimental analysis of dialogue styles has increased understanding of the effectiveness of active/passive expert roles in promoting learning in explanation. The discourse analysis has produced a novel taxonomic framework for the analysis of speech acts and question types in explanation. The results have led to refined definitions of discourse acts and further improvements to the theoretical models. Models of information seeking and answer generation have been described. Rhetorical structure theory has been used to study the functional aspects of information seeking, conversation control and experts replies in explanation dialogues. Dialogue planning processes have been developed from this analysis using task, topic focus and interaction models. A planning model for explanation generation has been developed as have linguistic formalisms fo r functional analysis of explanation dialogues and planners for discourse control. Computational models have been developed for knowledge representation of task and domain knowledge and their attendant retrieval processes. Prototype implementations of the extended task knowledge structures (TKS) and retrieval processes have been completed using a frame based environment. Final work is in progress to create a unifying example to demonstrate various components of the theory and models.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The research is multidisciplinary involving linguistics, cognitive science and computer science (knowledge engineering and human-computer interaction). Three approaches were followed: theoretical development, experimental studies and computational modelling. The action has three complimentary theoretical/empirical themes: 
-Theory of explanation and explanation plannning: Considerations for the theory have included study of the ontology of explanation, necessary criteria for successful explanation, schemas of task based and domain knowledge, and process models of explanati on delivery. This work is integrated with planning models for control of explanatory conversations, covering speech acts, topic focus and strategies for information delivery. Planning models, derived from studies of experts' behaviour and experimental testing cover question analysis, discourse focus maintainance and strategies for explanation generation. 
-Linguistically motivated dialogue models involve development of planning models for understanding user needs from language input using formal semantic models of the propositional content of questions. This work has developed specifications of dialogue p rocesses for topic focus maintainance, conversational control and explanation generation which may also form the basis for more generic dialogue management. 
-Knowledge representation, retrieval and management has extended the theory of Task Knowledge Structures to include domain knowledge concepts for explanation and developed retrieval processes which search for appropriate domain knowledge according to a t yped definition of the users information need. Knowledge representation has been augmented by fuzzy set theory for expression of imprecise, liguistic information and approximate reasoning has been used to design processes of knowledge retrieval for decision support and explanation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The Action has made steady progress towards understanding the theoretical and practical research issues inherent in the development of computational models for explanation systems. Considerable empirical work has been completed in the analysis of a corpus of explanation dialogues for linguistic features, information provision  and explanation strategies. Experimental studies have provided further understanding about the effect of expert style on the quality and effectiveness of explanations. An initial th eory of explanation has been developed which considers the ontology, viewpoints and criteria for successful explanation. Planning models describe the process of the explanatory task incorporating strategies for explanation delivery and selection rules forgenerating appropriate content.  The theory of task knowledge structures has been extended to provide a domain knowledge model to support explanation. This has involved extension and formalisation of TKS knowledge representation, and development of theretr eval processes which take question types as input parameters and then generate appropriate retrieval strategies. Experimental analysis of dialogue styles has increased our understanding of the effectiveness of active/passive expert roles in promotinglearning in explanation.  The discourse analysis has produced a novel taxonomic framework for the analysis of speech acts and question types in explanation. This work has been validated by empirical  analysis of explanation corpus. The results have led to refined definitions of discourse acts and further improvements to the theoretical models. Models of information seeking and answer generation have been described. Rhetorical structure theory has been used to study the functional aspects of information seeking, conversation control and experts replies in explanation dialogues.  Dialogue planning processes have been developed from this analysis using task, topic focus and interaction models. A planning model for explanation generation has been develope d which in egrates delivery planning with dialigue control and accounts for task based explanation with demonstration. Linguistic formalisms for functional analysis of explanation dialogues and planners for discourse control have been developed.

Prototype implementations of the extended TKS knowledge structures and retrieval processes have been successfully completed using a frame-based environment.

A prototype high resolution sea floor mapping system has been development, making use of sophisticated signal processing, synthetic imaging algorithms and wide band transducer design. Software simulations of the performance of wide band synthetic sonar have been constructed, to assess image processing schemes. Numerical models of sonar echoes backscattered from the sea floor have been completed to determine how to interpret the data. The feasibility of towing a device from a vessel was investigated. Tests were carried out in water tanks, and parameters of experimental prototypes calculated from theory and experiment. Sea trials have been conducted to prove the feasibility of such a prototype (May 1993).
This will have to ensure both a great ease of use and high performances. To reach these aims, these systems will include innovative technology of wide-band signal processing and more particularly of synthetic aperture: while classical imaging systems (sonar) consider the ship movement as an external parameter and provide for each position a 'snapshot', the synthetic aperture sonars integrate these movements in the processing. As opposed to classical sonars, for which increasing the resolution proceeds from an increase of the array length (problem of manoeuvrability), a synthetic aperture sonar allows it to reach the same resolution using a small-sized towed array. The complexity of the system is thus no longer the immersed mechanical parts, but the electronic instrumentation, the signal processing and the trajectory systems.

a) excavate a mini-tunnel similar, except in length, to the contemplated disposal galleries, using the industrial techniques that would have to be dealt with for the full-size repository.
b) erect and support a large connecting chamber of the type needed at the intersection between main and disposal galleries.
c) install and operate a dummy gallery geometrically identical, except in length, to an actual disposal gallery.
d) monitor the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the clay layer, gallery concrete lining, filling material and metal shroud surrounding the dummy waste.
This project aims to demonstrate the constructive and operational soundness of vitrified waste disposal facilities, to investigate the near field effects produced by a combined heater and radiation source emplaced in the Boom clay, and to monitor the short and long term mechanical behaviour of tunnelled structures in Boom clay.

To date, the project has focussed on the design, selection and justification of the demonstration experiment main features, the gathering of technical information needed for selection and installation of the monitoring and heating equipment, and a comparative assessment of the available technologies for excavating the repository galleries and erecting their lining.

The CERBERUS test (control experiment with radiation of the Belgian repository for underground storage) is aimed at simulating the near field effects in an argillaceous environment of a Cogema high level radiactive waste (HLW) canister after 50 years cooling time. Various validation exercises of computer codes such as the program DOSEGEO (computation of dose rate), the program SOURCE (computation of pore water pressure around drilling and digging works) and the program TEMPPRES (computation of the thermohydromechanical behaviour of the Boom clay) are utilized.

The measurements of the dose rate have been performed by means of an ionisation chamber, Calcium sulphide: dysprosium, lithium fluoride and perspex dosimeters were also used. The results are compared to those obtained with the DOSEGEO model.
In the hydrological field, it appears that the pore water pressure are very sensitive to any temperature variation, and raising the pore water pressure can generate cracks.
The first simulation using the TEMPPRES model and the best available parameters for the behaviour of the Boom clay at high temperature was performed. It indicates that the general trends of the pore water pressure evolution can be reproduced, but the maximum value occurs later and the pore water pressure is generally overestimated in the simulation.

Follow up and monitoring of the long term behaviour of the concrete lined part, also called Test Drift, of the HADES underground research facility, of its terminal shotcreted front and of the surrounding clay mass.

Measurements around the Test Drift show a slow stabilization.

Comparison between pressure and deformation on the different measuring sections show a good agreement of the convergence and confinement curves.

Comparison between direct measurements of the lining pressure (by way of pressur
e cells) and calculated ones (from load cells measurements) show that pressure cells measurements are systemically lower than those of the load cells, but that the pressure build up is similar.

Measurements of the displacements in the clay mass above the Test Drift (settlingmeter and inclinometer devices installed before construction) were compared to those, at the same distance of the gallery axis, of the extensometer installed during the construction: the delayed convergence (the displacement after installation of the lining, measured by the second device) is only a small part of the total one. This is confirmed by the comparison between the clay wall displacement (inferred from the first type of devices) and the lining diametrical convergence.

INTERCLAY II is a coordinated benchmark exercise dealing with the numerical prediction of the rheology of clays. Its broad objectives are to improve confidence in long term predictions of geomechanical behaviour of clay in situations relevant to the underground disposal of radioactive waste.

Following a review of the basic ability of popularly used models and the computer codes which contain them, the following have been formulated:
an axisymmetric 1-dimensional approximation of a cylindrical (ie tunnel) excavation in clay under isothermal and isotropic conditions, with and without a centrally located heat source;
a 2-dimensional, axisymmetric approximation of the progressive excavation of a cylindrical tunnel in clay, again under isotropic, isothermal conditions. Such approximations are relevant to deep repositories;
a plane strain representation of a shallow lined trench repository founded on clay.
In all cases interest centres on the ability of various conceptual models (and the codes in which they are implemented) to predict steady state behaviour.
Work programme: 

There are to be 3 principal stages. 

In Stage 1 the basic ability of popularly used models and the computer codes which contain them will be briefly reviewed. The review comprises a comparison of the theoretical capabilities of the codes and their performance on 4 simple, somewhat hypothetical problems. 

In Stage 2 laboratory tests on reconstituted clays provide the basis for a computational benchmark problem. Participants are asked to replicate the measured laboratory behaviour as far as possible, in their calculations. 

In Stage 3 'in-situ' behaviour will be modelled. Sources of well validated in-situ behaviour are relatively scarce and a specially designed heater test is currently in progress at SCK's Mol research facility. Various other 'heater' tests at the Mol facility are stand-by candidates.

4338;JOUE0085;MIDCOM;;FP2-JOULE 1;;FP2;M I D C O M  II Multidimensional Imaging Diagnostics for Combustion;01/06/1992;30/06/1994;;"To develop and assess multidimensional imaging diagnostics suitable for use in studying combustion processes aiming to provide European Industry with powerful optical diagnostic tools which can help improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions of pollutants. 
To the co-ordinator's knowledge the MIDCOM II project has been the largest, co-ordinated study of the DFWM technique, assessing critically the potential of this emerging technique. Notable achievements have been the collection of data at high pressures using the double phase conjugate variant of the four wave mixing technique. However, the general mood at the final meeting was one of some disappointment regarding the magnitude of the technical challenges facing this technique, and the limitations that have become apparent. This is translated into a general view that whilst DFWM may have some niche applications, it is not going to be generally used for quantitative, multi-dimensional imaging of combustion environments in the foreseeable future. Significant advances in the optical power available and the laser beam profile would make DFWM much more applicable. 

On the positive side, very significant advances have been made regarding 2D temperature imaging, and diagnostic tools for soot, oxides of nitrogen and liquid/vapour phase fuel mixtures. Diagnostic techniques have also been developed for 3D imaging, for studying new molecules and for the simultaneous visualisation of either several different species, or temperature and species. The project has also reported a new development in multidimensional imaging for combustion, namely using polarisation spectroscopy. This has been demonstrated with 2D maps of temperature or species concentration having been obtained.
The research undertaken within this project is the extension of the MIDCOM I programme carried out under contract JOUE-CT89-0021. 

The majority of the research concentrates on two  specific laser based techniques : Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Degenerate Four Wave Mixing (DFWM). For LIF the emphasis is on further developing the technique and making its data more quantitative. DFWM is very much in its infancy with some fundamental questions unanswered. This project provides a unifying theme within which the DFWM technique will be evaluated. 

The principal activities to be undertaken in the MIDCOM II Programme are : 

To evaluate and compare the techniques of LIF and DFWM for measuring temperatures in a flame, to develop a technique for simultaneous measurement of temperature and concentration of species in flames using LIF/DFWM and the ability of both methods to detect and image NO in gas and coal flames. 

To develop and evaluate DFWM for application to high-pressure combustion systems (engines) and infrared DFWM for detection of species in flames and for probing turbulent non premixed sooting flames. 

To develop Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) for measuring soot volume fractions in non-premixed flames. 

To develop a system for measuring both soot and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in gaseous and in liquid fuel combustion. 

To use intelligent Image Analysis (IIA) to analyze LIF data from turbulent flames, with a view to correlating the data with the related physical properties.

The main aim of the research was to investigate and develop techniques and systems for automatic incident detection and traffic monitoring.

The research focussed on:
strategies for urban and extraurban incident and congestion detection;
software for AID (automatic incident detection) using UTC (urban traffic control) sensors.

The following results have been obtained:
in the urban area, a program to detect incidents using information from UTC detectors has been written and the software installed in London;
in the extraurban area a study has been made of the factors affecting the functional requirements of a detection and monitoring system;
methods for the short to medium term prediction of traffic flow have been developed and tested on 3 principal roadways in France;
a study of the potential for detecting incidents using information from beacon based dynamic route guidance systems has been completed;
work on the use of a knowledge based system (KBS) has been completed
Methods currently being used for incident detection and traffic monitoring or potentially available, from a number of different sources: 
- urban traffic control system detectors (urban only) 
- highway/motorway traffic control sensors (extra urban only) 
- route guidance systems 
- image processing techniques 
- in-vehicle equipment 
- knowledge based systems 
The project will examine the information available from the above sources and assess its usefulness for traffic monitoring and for the detection of congestion and incidents. Where appropriate, strategies for the detection of incidents will be developed. The strategies developed for congestion and incident detection and traffic monitoring will be compared taking into account their effectiveness in different network types/traffic levels, cost, etc. 
Guidelines will be produced to show which systems or combination of systems should be used in particular circumstances. 
Monitoring / incident detection systems in the urban and extra-urban areas will be studied separately. Recommendations on the value and feasibility of integrating urban and extra-urban systems and the most appropriate methods of monitoring at the interface between the urban/extra urban networks will be made.

Operational functions are extracted from the work performed by various groups. For each function, the anticipated time scale of its implementation, its consequences in terms of human machine interface (HMI) and its consequences in terms of control suite performance, are studied.

The experimental prototypes of future air traffic control (ATC) controller working positions (CWP) produced by different administrations are studied. The information available covers the following fields:
general architecture;

A collection of existing reports of experiments performed on advanced ATC systems and a literature review and database search on human factors findings from studies on advanced complex systems was carried out.

Several tasks are under progress:
initial definition of performance requirements;
definition of scenarios, tests, and experiments.
The work will be carried out by:  
- Industry, involving System, Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineers from Software Engineering Companies and ATC System Manufacturers;  
- ATM Research Centres and a University lab, involving HCI and AI Engineers, Human factors Specialists, Ergonomists and air traffic controllers.  

This will allow the definition and validation of long term solutions, with provision for intermediate transition steps.  

Thus, the project will produce:  
- a set of validated operational scenarios, taking into account the progressive enhancement of the ATM system (1995-2015);  
- detailed specifications of the Control suite and the CWP, which will enable design of products able to meet the requirements of Phase A (1995-2000);  
- general specifications for the evolution of the control suite and the CWPs in the ATM context of Phase B (2000-2015).

Key issues in the research included:
the identification of system requirements;
the compatibility of manufacturing technologies;
the design, fabrication and testing of components;
system testing of components;
technoeconomic considerations.

The research started with an initial definition of a set of requirements, followed by experimental work on first basic and integral structures. Ridge type 15 micron distributed feedback (DFB) and Fabry-Perot (FP) laser diodes and basic amplifier structures have been fabricated. A process for efficiently butt coupling these structures to low loss waveguides has been devised.

Three basic switch structures have been selected and modelled;

total internal reflection type;
directional coupler type.

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) chip waveguide material structures have been designed and evaluated. Holographic gratings for use in WDM couplers have been fabricated.

Integration with passive waveguides has been demonstrated for monitor photodiodes, optical switches, optical amplifiers, laser diodes and WDM couplers. These structures have been optimized for mutual onchip integration.
Technical Approach  

The chosen approach is structured as four hierarchical phases.  During the first phase, the basic optical functions to be developed were studied in terms of the requirements expressed by the system projects.  These included such functions as an optical amplifier, an optical switch, a laser diode, a photo-diode with a waveguide or a wavelength division multiplex unit. The project considered whether the technologies necessary to manufacture these individual components are compatible within a common process. This comparative evaluation of technologies continued in later phases of the project.  

During the second phase, all the basic optical components have been designed, fabricated and tested. In the third phase, the results of the two previous phases are used to develop a set of four integrated components.  These are to be:  

. an optical amplifier with an optical switch  
. a laser diode with an optical switch  
. a laser diode with photo-diode and a waveguide  
. a wavelength division multiplex unit with a laser diode.  

The fourth and final phase will be dedicated to testing the developed components and assessing their conformance with the techno-economic requirements of system manufacturers.

Achievements  
The project started with an initial definition of a set of requirements, followed by experimental work on first basic and integral structures.  Ridge type 1.5 micron DFB and FP laser diodes and first basic amplifier structures have been fabricated.  A process for efficiently butt coupling these structures to low-loss waveguides has been devised, and the coupling has been achieved by both the LPE and the MOVPE technique. First monitor photo-diodes have been made using the ridge waveguide structure operating under reverse bias, and a sensitivity of 0.34 A/W has been achieved.  

Three basic switch structures have been selected and modelled, the passive Y type, total internal reflection type, and directional coupler type.  Directional coupler switches making use of the free carrier plasma effect were fabricated and operated at an extremely low switching current of 4 mA, the lowest value reported today.  

WDM chip waveguide material structures have been designed and evaluated.  Holographic gratings for use in WDM couplers have been fabricated.  

Integration with passive waveguides has been demonstrated for monitor photo-diodes, optical switches, optical amplifiers, laser-diodes and WDM couplers.  These structures have been optimised for mutual on-chip integration.

8256;3215;CHEOPS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Higher-Order Logic-Supported Design for Complex Data-Processing Systems;01/08/1989;31/03/1992;;"For achieving hardware design correctness, theorem provers such as HOL and Boyer-Moore have been applied for verification. However, in order to construct the correctness proofs, much effort and expertise is required; for nearly every new application new efforts are needed. These methods should only be employed in exceptional cases. 
High level hardware synthesis techniques are now emerging. The CATHEDRAL design system allows the synthesis of integrated circuits for digital signal processing applications from the high-level behavioural specifications  down to the layout. These systems are very complex and integrate a number of techniques, such as data path allocation, scheduling, bus merging, controler synthesis, module generation, layout etc. The costs of design processing iterations due to design bugs is high. Therefore, cross-check ing the results of automatic synthesis is very important. 
The aim of this Action was to investigate the use of the theorem-proving assistant HOL for proving the correctness of systems synthesised by the CATHEDRAL silicon compilers. Instead of investing the proof effort for each design, the proofs will be made reusable across a whole class of designs. This makes the invested proof effort reusable.
The theorem proving assistant higher order logic (HOL) was used for proving the correctness of complex data processing systems that are synthesized by the CATHEDRAL silicon compilers.

The following results have been achieved so far:
implementation of a general purpose parser generator to support syntactic aspects of embedding SILAGE in HOL;
definition of SILAGE semantics in HOL and embedding in the parser generator;
definition of a number of correctness preserving transformations based on the formal semantics of SILAGE which have been proven correct;
development of a proof methodology for parameterized hardware modules in the CATHEDRAL-II silicon compiler for microcoded digital signal processing (DSP) architectures and application of this methodology for the CATHEDRAL-II ALU;
comparison of HOL and Boyer-Moore for the transformational design of parameterized hardware;
development of a theory in HOL for finite word length arithmetic, which is essential for correctly dealing with DSP applications such as in CATHEDRALs;
development of the signal flow graph (SFG) tracing methodolgy for the automatic verification of lower level implementations (down to switch level transistor circuits as extracted from layout) up to high level SFG algorithmic specifications at the SILAGE level;
automatic verification of CATHEDRAL-1 and CATHEDRAL-2 synthesis results for circuits up to 32000 transistors;
improvement of the user interface of HOL by means of the CENTAUR system.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
HOL was used to formalise a verification strategy to prove the correctness of the synthesis results. Although synthesis normally assumes correctness by construction, a double check of the results will enhance confidence in the design correctness, and willassist in avoiding costly design iterations due to errors introduced by designers or software tools. 
To achieve this, appropriate steps in the synthesis trajectory of the CATHEDRAL silicon compilers have been selected for either applying formal design (transformational design) by means of theorem proving in HOL or applying formal verification for increased quality assurances and correctness. 
In addition to this, feedback was to be given on the use of the HOL system, and further extensions will be made towards its usability for proving hardware correctness. The capabilities and user interface of the HOL system itself were to be improved and extended. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The following results have been achieved up to now: 
-A general-purpose parser generator has been implemented to support syntactic aspects of embedding SILAGE in HOL. 
-Definition of SILAGE semantics in HOL and embedding in the parser generator. 
-Based on the formal semantics of SILAGE a number of correctness preserving transformations have been defined and proven correct. 
-Development of a proof methodology for parameterised hardware modules in the CATHEDRAL-II silicon compiler for micro-coded DSP architectures. Application of this methodology for the CATHEDRAL-II ALU. 
-Comparison of HOL and Boyer-Moore for the transformational design of parameterised hardware. 
-Development of a theory in HOL for finite word length arithmetic, which is essential for correctly dealing with digital signal processing applications such as in CATHEDRALs. 
-Development of the SFG-Tracing methodology for the automatic verification of lower level implementations (down to switch level transistor circuits as extracted from layout) up to high level signal flow graph algothmic specifications at the SILAGE level. -Automatic verification of CATHEDRAL-1 and CATHEDRAL-2 synthesis results for circuits up to 32,000 transistors (in cooperation with CHARME (3216)). 
-Improvement of the user interface of HOL by means of the CENTAUR system (INRIA). 
POTENTIAL 
The results of this Action will provide progress in methodologies for proving the correctness of synthesis results. The effort required in developing such proofs is distributed and shared by the many design instances that are generated by silicon compilers. This will greatly reduce the effort of proving systems correct and substantially enhance confidence in a design's correctness. New insights have been gained in how to apply and improve the HOL system for verifying correct hardware. Based on the experience with verifying the correctness of generic synthesis steps and design representations, new insights have been gained in how to develop new constructive synthesis methodologies based on theorem-prover concepts.";;;;;INTERUNIVERSITAIR MIKROELEKTRONICA CENTRUM;BE;"NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;University of Cambridge";"NL;UK";

Applications for these devices lie in the field of high-speed signal processing, high-frequency satellite broadcasting, and semiconductor laser-related information transmission and storage.
The aim of the project is to develop high throughput, industrial metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) equipment suitable for the fabrication of the complex III-V heterostructures required in microelectronics and optoelectronics. The equipment is based on a completely new concept of and MOVPE system allowing simultaneous growth of 7 wafers in planetary motion, using gas foil rotation. An industrial system has been defined and constructed, and improvements are being implemented. A mathematical model is also developed to simulate the growth. The performances of the equipment are outstanding: the layer thickness uniformity on 2 inch and 3 inch wafers is within \1% and the composition is well reproducible within 0.5%, whilst the average surface defect density is 5/cm{2}. The evaluation of the system in microelectronics is made with high electron mobility transistors; high values of cut-off frequencies (65 GHz) are obtained with low dispersion. In optoelectronics, the very low laser current densities (400 A/cm{2}) obtained also show the excellent quality of the material. The new MOVPE system will supply the sophisticated epitaxial heterostructures required for the developing applications in microelectronics and optoelectronics.

The goal of the PLANET project is to develop high throughput, multiwafer metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) equipment suitable for the realization of complex III-V heterostructure materials for electronic and optoelectronic devices and circuits. The project consists of the development and improvement of a reactor prototype, tests of the design, and its application to various types of III-V materials, including indium and phosphorus containing compounds. Throughout the project, epitaxy, characterization and device research support the equipment development work, and reactor modelling supports reactor optimization. Considerable hardware improvements have been implemented. Qualification of the prototype reactor has been successfully made. Agreement between observed parameter behaviour and dimensional simulations is satisfactory.
Homogeneity of layer thickness on 2 inch wafers is excellent (of the order of 1%) for aluminium gallium arsenide multilayer structures. Aluminium gallium arsenide multiple quantium well (MQW) lasers show excellent behaviour and good reliability. The results have been extended towards larger substrate sizes. First results on 3 inch substrates are very promising. Indium gallium arsenide pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) have been successfully realised with a high day to day reproducibility. Emphasis is now on a 3 inch process for these pseudomorphic HEMT.
First layers of indium gallium phosphide and aluminium indium gallium phosphide for visible lasers have been grown. The evaluation results are very positive. Growth of laser structures for visible lasers is underway. Indium gallium arsenic phosphide/indium phosphide waveguides have been designed, and low losses realised by etching the waveguides using reactive ion etching (RIE). A preliminary evaluation has been made of indium gallium phosphide and indium aluminium phosphide visible laser materials grown in a conventional reactor.
3-dimensional simulations have b een successfully performed the defect density of the layers gas been found to be consistently below 10 defects cm{-2}, with the best results below 1 cm{-2}.
The project consisted of the development and improvement of a reactor prototype by an experienced MOVPE equipment manufacturer, tests of the design, and its application to various types of III-V materials, including In- and P-containing compounds. AlGaAs FETs and lasers were made for qualification of the PLANET reactor for these applications. In the second phase, a similar approach was taken towards improved InGaAs transistors and visible lasers made of InGaAlP. Throughout the project, epitaxy, characterisation and device research supported the equipment development work, and reactor modelling supported reactor optimisation.";;;;;Laboratoire d'Électronique Philips;FR;"AIXTRON GmbH;TELEFONICA;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;POLYFLOW SA;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID";"DE;ES;NL;BE";

The project aimed to develop powerful and effective systems for supporting distributed collaborative work. The approach adopted is to integrate components from a number of existing systems and to develop new collaborative tools based on the study of a large scale technical application that encompasses many collaboration problems.

A task monitoring system was developed which enabled people to keep track of the status and results of ongoing collaborative activities. It provided support for asynchronous group work. It notified those involved of deadlines and expected actions, alerted users in case of emerging difficulties, or enabled them to delegate tasks to others. An an addition to this system, meeting support tools were developed. Synchronous document preparation by a distributed group of people is important in many collaborative projects. A prototype of a synchronous shared window conferencing tool was developed and will be further improved. This especially supports the codesign of documents.
Information must be shared as required between members of a distributed work group. Such information will be of many different forms, and must be linked in many different ways. A distributed hypermedia design toolkit provides support for the design of documents containing a broad range of different materials, including the ability to specify links between and within these documents. The documents are stored in a distributed object oriented database. A user centred approach has been taken in the design and development of these tools. The application area was the project management of the construction of a combined bridge and tunnel over the Great Belt in Denmark.
An increasing number of people are involved in projects that are distributed within or even between organisations, so that people often collaborate with others in different physical locations. EUROCOOP aimed to provide integrated computer tools and services to support such spatially distributed groups, with a particular focus on project management issues. 

Project management is a difficult task in the best of circumstances. It becomes even more complicated if a geographically distributed group of people is involved.

14507;R1041;FUNCODE;;FP2-RACE 1;;FP2;Functional Specifications of Codecs;01/01/1988;31/12/1990;;"FUNCODE deals with the techno-economic considerations of codec technology related to the IBC Reference Configuration.  The generic service aspects are also treated.  

FUNCODE seeks to contribute to standardisation activities through RACE consensus and the Common Functional Specifications.  The project will also act as a market interface, particularly in the field of digital image coding and transmission. 
The main aim of the research was to investigate the technoeconomic aspects of codec technology with reference to the integrated broadband communications (IBC) reference configuration. The generic service aspects were also considered. The research dealt with:
the compression of information (coding) as a means of reducing the bit rate transmission cost;
the location of codecs, when their initial cost is too high for them to be located in terminals;
the tradeoff between transmission cost, loss of service quality and service interoperability;
the impact of variable bit rate (VBR) transmission.

The research resulted in the following conclusions:
video codecs should be located in the terminal;
one possibility for overcoming the worsening situation regarding interoperability between video standards is to develop one common picture transmission standard based on a descriptive programming language for picture coding.
Technical Approach  

Being a systems project, FUNCODE does not produce hardware or software, but detailed analytical studies of codec technology in relation to the IBC.  Results are recorded in deliverables available to all RACE actors.  

Most of the project objectives can be achieved through detailed analytical work.  Computer methods will be used for both modelling and assessment.  Subjective quality assessment may also be involved.  

FUNCODE actively contributes to the common functional specifications (ie E223, E224, J100, J210, J225, J255, J260, J263, J264, J265), and acts as chairman of STG5.1.  

To focus on the key issues, project work has been sub- divided into workpackages dealing with inter-operability, coding vs service, codec location and codec evolution.  

Key Issues  

- Compression of information (coding) as a means of reducing the bit-rate transmission cost.  
- The location of the codecs, when their initial cost is too high for them to be located in terminals.  
- Trade off between transmission cost, loss of service quality and service inter-operability.  
- The impact of variable bit rate (VBR) transmission.  

Achievements  

The project has produced a number of deliverables which are kept constantly under review and in some instances, re-issued every year.  

The deliverable covering IBC scenarios in the light of activities in CCITT SG XVIII concludes with rather exact recommendations on the type of video codecs that shall be developed for different services.  

In addressing the issue as to where video codecs should be located, the overall conclusion is that these should be placed in the terminal.  This is also the obvious place for minimising transmission requirements in all parts of the network.  In introductory phases sharing of codecs could be an economic alternative however.  

The project has recognised one possibility to overcome the worsening situation regarding inter-operability between video standards.  This is to develop one common picture transmission standard based on a descriptive programming language for picture coding.  The decoding algorithm for this would be transmitted along with the coded picture information.  This solution overcomes the problem of transcoding, which otherwise can only be solved by complete decoding followed by coding with the new method.  

In the deliverable Codec Evolution 1990-2010, FUNCODE gives its view that there will be a large increase in the demand for and use of, moving picture and video information, for foreseen applications but also in completely new areas.  

The project has reported on the performance and costs of codecs for some important audio visual services.  Amongst the conclusions are that technology for low cost domestic videotelephones will be available before 1995, that the economic interest of codecs will not decrease at the advent of low cost broadband networks. The most strategic components will be cameras and displays.

The emergence of technology that allows the creation of highly complex data communication networks and the aspirations of customers to gain control of their equipment has led to a strong demand for integrated network management systems (INMS).
The project was designed to: 
explore, analyse and specify all the implications, aspects and solutions involved with the emergence, design and future implementations of a network performance management (NPM) system: deliverables included a demonstration of limited laboratory examples which validated the feasibility and efficiency of certain functions of the specified NPM application; 
contribute to the standardization process concerned with the NPM system applied in heterogeneous contexts;

the study, specification and development of an architecture and environment to take into account the heterogeneous context; 
the study and specification of a model providing a software environment defined to be (from a theoretical point of view) the most suitable to enable tuning and capacity planning; 
the study and specification of the modelling of performance data in terms of objects and attributes; 
the study and detailed specifications of advanced information processing techniques, used, in particular, to help operators manage performance in a preventative way and in a real time environment. 

The prototype of this NPM application gave rise to several contributions to standards setting bodies, and these specifications provided directions and guidelines to develop, implement and demonstrate the prototype of a standardized NPM tool.
The project dealt with a major component of future INMSs: performance management, which is the area of network management supporting strategic decisions and defining the tactical decisions required to maintain a high service level.

- comfort management 
- energy control 
- access to the public telephone network for services like home banking and teleshopping. 

The HIVE project will develop and implement in prototypes new MMI principles, an MMI unit and the related IR system necessary for operating the total home system in an easy and logical way. HIVE will investigate whether the protocols developed in the project 2431, HOME project are sufficient for use in such a system; if not, new protocols and hardware will be developed. The objective of the MMI design is to develop a unified home automation interface across participants' products which will simplify user interaction with the home. 

An MMI simulator tool will be specified and developed in order to develop the right MMI principles and the unit. The tool will be PC-based, with some additional hardware to make it possible to simulate and experience the MMI before it is implemented in products. The development of the software necessary for the tool will be based on the experience of the partners with existing MMI tools.

8206;3168;DX CENTRES;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Limiting Factors in III-V Semiconductor Devices due to Donor-Related Deep States;01/04/1989;31/03/1992;;"DX centres are deep levels associated with donors in III-V semiconductors. As these deep levels disturb the band-gap structure of the semiconductor, they are unwanted. This Action aimed to understand the physics and control of these deep levels in high band-gap III-V semiconductors. The structural, optical and electrical characteristics of DX centres, as well as their effects on various device structures, were studied in GaAs and AlGaAs alloys. The ultimate goal was to provide guidelines for materials anddopants selection and device structure design that avoids or minimises DX centre effects. It is expected that the knowledge obtained about AlGaAs in this respect will be applicable to other III-V and compound semiconductors. .
High Bandgap III-V (gallium arsenic like) materials, especially aluminium gallium arsenic alloys, were the focus of a study into n-type dopant behaviour in semiconductor materials and devices. The electronic structure and the electrical and optical properties structure and the electrical and optical properties of these materials doped with usual and more exotic donors were systematically examined. Processing conditions and device structures that avoid or minimize 'DX centre' effects were defined.

Tellurium, tin and selenium donors have been characterized and their advantages over silicon for device behaviour at low temperatures confirmed.
The electron capture kinetics have been studied by both capacitance and magnetotransport techniques, clarifying the origin of the strong nonexponential processes. There is evidence that the donor local environment affects the energy level structure of the DX centres. The radiative properties of the DX centres are being investigated. The presence of intrinsic point defects in aluminium gallium arsenic has been analysed to understand the origin of infrared emission in n-type aluminium gallium arsenic alloys. The near bandgap emissions have been probed by piezophotoluminescence techniques.
By magnetotransport experiments in aluminium gallium arsenic and gallium arsenic phosphorus under hydrostatic pressure, it has been shown the tellurium introduces a DX centre in gallium arsenic and gallium arsenic phosphorus that is more than 100 meV above the corresponding related and tin related DX centres.
Magnetic resonance experiments provided breakthroughs. Results on the tin, tellurium and silicon donors in aluminium gallium arsenic layers gave evidence for a diamagnetic DX ground state. Low temperature photoexcitation process are rise to the formation of paramagnetic donor states.
In order to minimize the effects of the DX centres in devices, guidelines for the selection of donor species have been presented favouring the use of group VI donors. The growth of aluminium gallium arsenic on silicon substrates indicated that the biaxial strain achieved did not induce significant changes in the DX behaviour. The benefits of using gamma doping in high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structures received special attention. Indium aluminium arsenic and indium gallium phosphates doped with silicon were studied in detail due to their technological importance. No DX centres were detected for compositions below tellurium 60% or phosphorus 60%, repectively.
Because the DX state is intrinsic to n-type doping, no real way to suppress DX centres in aluminium gallium arsenic has been found.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
A selected set of samples that include variations of the Al fraction in AlGaAs, doping level and donor chemical species have been defined and fabricated by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques. Si, Sn, Se,Te, and Pb donors have been selected as dopants. 
A variety of structural, optical, magnetotransport and space charge spectroscopy techniques have been systematically applied to the set of samples. A theoretical modelling effort is also included. 
In a second stage, neutron transmutation experiments, superlattice structures, double-doping, delta-doping, atomic layer epitaxy, strain effects, and high flux donor incorporation was planned. Basic DX microstructure knowledge was obtained, while donors, materials, doping procedures and device structures was also compared for DX minimisation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Te, Sn and Se donors have been characterised to a large extent, and their advantages over Si for device behaviour at low temperatures confirmed. HEMT structures using Se have shown a much reduced III-V collapse and persistent photoconductivity effect at 77 K as compared to Si-doped devices. In GaAs doped with Te, resonant DX states lie at significantly higher energy levels than those due to Si and Sn. 
-The electron capture kinetics have been studied by both capacitance and magnetotransport techniques, clarifying the origin of the strong non-exponential processes. There is evidence that the donor local environment may affect the energy level structureof the DX centres. The subject of the radiative properties of the DX centres is being fully investigated. The presence of intrinsic point defects in AlGaAs, claimed to be As antisites, has been analysed to understand the origin of infrared emission in n-type AlGaAs alloys. The near-bandgap emissions have been probed by piezo-photoluminescence techniques. 
-By magnetotransport experiments in AlGaAs and GaAsP under hydrostatic pressure, it has been shown the Te introduces a DX center in GaAs and GaAsP that is more than 100 meV above the corresponding Si and Sn-related DX centers. This result has practical i mplications in achieving high doping levels in GaAs. By transport analysis in Si- and Sn-codoped AlGaAs, strong support for the negative-U, DX- model has also been obtained. 
-Magnetic resonance experiments provided breakthroughs. By independent techniques, results on the Sn, Te and Si donors in AlGaAs layers gave strong evidence for a diamagnetic DX ground state, in agreement with negative-U models. Low-temperature photoexci tation process gives rise to the formation of paramagnetic donor states. 
-In order to minimise the effects of the DX centers in devices, guidelines for the selection of donor species have been presented favouring the use of group VI donors. In alloying has not been shown to be really helpful. It was shown that Pb is not an al ternative. The growth of AlGaAs on Si substrates indicated that the biaxial strain achieved did not induce significant changes in the DX behaviour. The benefits of using gamma-doping in HEMT structures received special attention. InAlAs and InGaP doped with Si were studied in detail due to their technological importance. No DX centers were detected for compositions below Al 60% or P 60%, respectively. 
-The results achieved in this Action have contributed to significantly advancing the understanding of the behaviour of donors in III-V compounds. However, this behaviour has shown to be even more complex than it was initially thought. Donor atoms introdu ce shallow EM states, thought to correspond to pure substitutional behaviour, and the DX states, that are understood to be due to a distorted position when filled. Finally, because the DX state is intrinsic to n-type doping, no real way to suppress DX centers in AlGaAs has been found. 
POTENTIAL 
Because of the wide use of n-type regions in III-V device technology, the understanding of n-type dopant behaviour, and the corresponding understanding and control of DX centres, will have a profound impact on material doping procedures and device design.Knowledge that makes possible better alloy composition and device design will help minimise the deleterious effects of deep donors in III-V optoelectronics, high-speed devices and ICs.";;;;;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;ES;"UNIVERSITY OF LUND;Università degli Studi di Pisa;UNIVERSITE DE PARIS VII;University of Sheffield;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;UNIVERSITAET - GESAMTHOCHSCHULE PADERBORN";"SE;IT;FR;UK;DE";

The project is concerned with defining and applying techniques from the area of distributed artificial intelligence to the development of industrial applications. Such techniques enable multiple problem solvers (eg expert systems, databases and conventional numerical software systems) to communicate and cooperate with each other to improve both their individual problem solving behaviour and the behaviour of the community as a whole. This paper outlines the niche of architecture for cooperative heterogenous online systems (ARCHON) in the distributed artificial intelligence world and provides an overview of the philosophy and architecture of our approach, which is both general (applicable to the domain of industrial process control) and powerful enough to handle problems such as electricity management, cement factory control, robotics and the control of a particle accelerator.

The project aimed to develop an architectural and software framework for multiagent systems for real world industrial applications in the area of process control and supervision. To achieve this aim, these key issues were accomplished:
identification of suitable concepts and implementation of these as a prototype (the abstract machine);
building of appropriate domain systems for the demonstration application and testing and evaluation of the abstract machine prototype;
design and implementation of the ARCHON tools which can be used on a general basis after the end of the project, accompanied by a well defined and usable instructions on how to apply the ARCHON framework to an application.

The applications oriented results were divided into 3 domains:
the demonstrator application on energy management;
the prototype application on electricity distribution;
application studies on fault finding and operation help in complex computer controlled systems.
The following activities were undertaken to achieve this aim: identifying suitable DAI and distributed database concepts and implementation of these in C\\ as working software - the Abstract Machine; building appropriate domain systems for the demonstration of applications and for testing and evaluating the Abstract Machine; and designing and implementing the ARCHON tools, accompanied by a well-defined and usable methodology on how to apply the ARCHON framework to an application.";;;;;Krupp GmbH;DE;"AMPER COMPUTER SERVICES;UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM;IBERDUERO;UNIVERSIDAD DO PORTO;VOLMAC NEDERLAND BV;CERN;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;LABORATORIO DE ENSAYOS E INVESTIGACIONES INDUSTRIALES;Electricity Association Ltd;European Communities - Commission of the European Communities - Joint Research Centre (JRC);Framentec Cognitech SA;UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS";"EL;NL;ES;PT;CH;BE;UK;IT;FR";

(1) to introduce ICPC as a tool for the standardization of data collection and data management, supported by coding rules and defined terminology for use in general practice settings in the European Community; 
(2) to promulgate a common knowledge base allowing for the translation of ICPC into the different languages of the European Community, to support the comparability of data collected in health care settings under different conditions in different countries; 
(3) to compare encounter- and episode-based clinical information collected and classified with ICPC by general practitioners in different countries, and to initiate a change in the orientation of health statistics in the European Community towards episode oriented databases. 
In the Concerted Action 'ICPC in the European Community', 4 major achievements can be distinguished.
The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), a reliable, feasible and valid instrument for coding the patient's reasons for encounter, the doctor's diagnoses and the interventions, has been translated and published as a free standing publication in 6 languages (Danish, Dutch, Greek, French, Norwegian and Spanish). Moreover, translations into 9 other languages (Basque, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Swedish) have been prepared and are included in the multilanguage layer, which consequently contains ICPC in 16 languages. All translations will shortly be available on a floppy disk for use in computerized information systems.

A complete computerized conversion between ICPC and International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) has been established, which together with the multilanguage layer makes a European patient record for routine use now a realistic option.

Data collection in 207 300 encounters by 339 general practitioners (GP) in 9 countries, and coded with ICPC are included in the Concerted Action. These data confirmed both the feasibility of ICPC in encounter and episode based studies, and the validity of the reason for encounter, indicating a high degree of patient physician agreement. Several studies concentrate on the use of ICPC together with other instruments, on Functional Status indicators, on the prescription of drugs and more formal aspects of episode oriented databases.

In addition to this, several studies have resulted in publications that support and illustrate ICPC's widespread acceptance.
To execute this project the following steps were proposed: 

(1) appointing one or two co-investigators from each of the participating European countries and involving general practitioners with similar interest from other countries; 
(2) organizing workshops to formulate both the general objectives and the specific requirements, to train participants in the use of ICPC, to develop a strategy for the preparation of translations of ICPC and to select countries where a comparative study could be performed. 

More precise definitions of the main objectives of the first phase of the ICPC project in the European Community are 
(1) to investigate the feasibility, reliability, and relevance of ICPC for the harmonization and standardization of patient-oriented information in primary care in the EC; and 
(2) to integrate research on classification systems in primary care within the EC.";;;;CON;University of Amsterdam;NL;;;

Initial research indicated that banking will continue to change and that the ability to bring new or modified products to market will grow in importance as competition intensifies. The studies carried out by the BANK '92 project indicated that an open distributed system addresses most needs of banks in IT area.

Results will be in the form of a definition of a set of interfaces for the implementation of distributed applications in the personal banking domain, specifically within sales activities, and a demonstration of a suite of banking prototype applications, selected from this domain, that clearly show the benefits of the designed architecture. It is expected that the BANK '92 partners, and other members of the European IT industry, will produce fully productised versions of the blueprint developed by the project. As market exploitation is expected to begin in 1992/93, the project will concentrate on strategic issues and requirements which will remain valid for many years. 

BANK '92 is particularly concerned to take into account the requirements, needs and trends of the European banking market and to produce results relevant for this market. To gain valid requirements from the banking sector and to ensure the acceptability of the project findings, the consortium will set up a special bank advisory group (BAG) and take advice from an expert panel. 

The project will exploit the results of other ESPRIT projects (ISA, COMANDOS) and use Open Distributed Systems Architecture. This will support interworking within a heterogeneous hardware and operating system environment. The architecture will be non-proprietary and based on multivendor equipment, thereby contributing to increased competition, lower prices and greater choices for banks. It will also guarantee a long-term preservation of the banks' investments in IT. It will be based on object-oriented concepts and will support replication of data. These features will prove valuable to the banks in the necessary restructuring from account-oriented to customer-oriented databases. 

The project will then add to this basis architecture services which are specific to actual and evolving banking needs (such as a customer information service). The result will be a Banking Application Architecture (BAC) which will not only simplify the development of new applications on a distributed system but also facilitate their portability to other operating systems supporting BAC. To demonstrate BAC and its benefits, the project will develop a suite of prototype applications in the sales activity business domain. 

BAC will put special emphasis on: 

- an open distributed architecture based on the use of standards 
- distributed run-time and development environment 
- run-time services (UAI, data management, banking applications services).

The project creates a set of productivity tools for professional hypertext authoring with quality, efficiency and flexibility. The approach rests on an innovative hypertext design model (HDM). The structure of an hypertext application is specified on an high conceptual level using a graphical HDM editor. From this high level specification, the compiler and targeting tools can then build up concrete hypertext applications in a variety of commercial hypertext systems. In this process, many links and visualization elements are generated automatically. This reduces the effort for creation and maintenance of hypertext applications, ensures consistency and completeness of hypertext structures, and permits flexible application configurations.
The target of the project is applications which exhibit a number of specific features: the body of information to be represented is very large and complex; the authoring effort is long-lasting (continuous maintenance or updates); and there is a clear-cut distinction between authors and readers. 

For applications with the above features, authors need support in several respects: 

- an application-oriented model to define the structure (ie the schema) of the applications 
- an application-oriented model to define the objects (ie instances) which populate the application 
- a way to 'translate' the application developed with the above model into an implementation model (the features of which can be exemplified by the Dexter reference model for hypertext systems) 
- tools to support all these phases: specification, design, development, debugging, maintenance, etc. 

The expected results of HYTEA are: 
- an application-oriented model to describe schemas of hypertext applications 
- an application-oriented model to represent an application according to a predefined schema 
- a model to translate the representations defined at above into an implementation with a conventional hypertext system 
- tools to support the definition of schemas, the modelling of an application, the 'translation' of the application into a conventional application, and the maintenance of that application 
- a number of prototype applications. 

Different media will be supported (both in the model and in the tools): text, still graphics, animated graphics, sound, still images, video images, etc. The implementation environment will support a number of different standards and technologies: CD, CD-I, DVI, etc.

The COSMOS tool provides and OPEN environment for using metrics to support the software specification, design, build and test process.

COSMOS has been developed to a complete metrics environment, offering data collection tools for different programming languages, facilities for interfacing with external metrics tools, metrics data exchange facilities, a database for metrics storage, graphical analysis capabilities and reporting and plotting facilities. All these features bring complete support for metrics data collection and metrics usage.
The basic concept is to monitor software attributes during development, from an early development phase onwards. This concept was further developed during the project and we found many similarities with Statistical Process Control (SPC); a well known industrial mechanism.";;;;;TECHFORCE BV;NL;"TELEFONICA SISTEMAS;ALCATEL AUSTRIA - ELIN;NIJENRODE UNIVERSITEIT VOOR BEDRIJFSKUNDE;Goldsmiths' College;British Telecom plc (BT)";"ES;AT;NL;UK";

The final goal is to provide the user with an opportunity to query in his own language text databases written in various languages. It will also make it possible to query simultaneously in one language databases containing texts in several different languages.
A feasibility study is being carried out into the automatic indexing of free text and the multilingual querying of text databases. At the end of the study, tools and utilities designed for such purposes will have been embodied in a demonstration prototype. To develop this, existing tools will be used to carry out such tasks as automatic indexing (based on statistical methods and using a linguistic treatment which employs morphological and syntactic analysis). The automatic indexing method produces, as part of the formatted database, a statistical model which can be used during the query answering phase to sort documents according to a relevance hierarchy. Monolingual queries in natural language can use a reformulation expert system which has at its disposal a large vocabulary stock. Work has started on an existing English/French prototype extending to an English/German pair which requires the development of an analyzer for German. The French/German pair will follow, resulting in a trilingual query system. Methods and tools could then be applied to other languages. Multilingual text databases will be employed.

A first prototype of the bilingual French English interrogation system has been developed. It is based on word for word translations.
A second prototype capable of taking multiunit words and expressions into account is currently in the experimental stage.
The final version of the bilingual prototype integrating both kinds of translations will be ready at the end of 1993. At the same time, a first version of the German monolingual prototype has been developed. It is based on a linguistic analysis integrating a morphological analysis including the treatment of 1-word compounds. This analysis is based on the full term dictionary. The syntactic analysis includes grammatical disambiguation and a simplified recognition of dependency relations.
The system developed within the project must be domain dependent. When processing a new domain, little work is needed to adapt the dictionaries and the user is helped by tools developed inside the project to perform this adaptation. More specifically, a semi-automatic method has been developed to extract compounds and their translations from texts that have already been translated. 

In order to prove the generality of the approach, experimentation is done on three languages: English, French, and German. The English-French and French-German couples are currently under work. The German parser has been developed within the framework of the project. This parser specifically takes into account the splitting of compounds which is crucial for information retrieval systems.";;;;;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);FR;"SYSTEX;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;Transmodul Software GmbH";"FR;BE;DE";

The project aimed to develop an advanced and flexible workbench for fast and cheap development of a range of compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM) applications to be used as an integrated part of the professional workstations of the 1990s.

The workbench was designed with an open architecture with clearly separated layers and modules to allow for future extensions. It was based on a number of international and industry standards to ensure the broadest range of applications, and met the need for an open extendible software based workbench that would provide an integrated set of tools covering the main activities in the CD-ROM production process. The project encompassed the development of 1 or 2 real life applications to test the viability of the results and to demonstrate how CD-ROM could be used in the future.

The main objectives of the project were to:
provide the partners with an integrated workbench covering the entire production process for multimedia CD-ROM titles;
provide publishers who have little computer experience with the opportunity to get involved in CD-ROM publishing by means of the highly interactive easy to use workbench;
make a significant contribution to the European information industry by preventing similar non-European products drawing away a significant amount of royalties.

The project resulted in a set of tools that together form the CD-ROM workbench. The workbench includes modules for data transformation, text indexing and retrieval, hyperindex libraries, storyboard editor, data preparation and simulation, and database viewer for Windows. Most of the modules exist both for the Unix and disc operating system (DOS) world. The modular setup allowed for further developments in line with the growing demands of the markets and to conform with the evolving standards in the market.
Optical devices for data storage are an extremely promising information technology, allowing editors and publishers to store and distribute very large databases (information banks) in a very cost-effective way (editors are here defined as those who know how to present information to end-users). Providing information implies using multimedia information such as text, graphics, audio and video, coupled with easy-to-use advanced interactive retrieval systems. 

The fast-emerging need for new types of application software that allow the seamless integration of information and standard applications can hardly be met by the software industry. The lack of suitable development environments and efficient tools for read-only media is seen as one of the main obstacles. Though the technology is available, editors and the software developers are in urgent need of an integrated workbench (a development environment of tools and methodologies based on commonly used standards) which would allow them to use optical media in a cost- and functionality-competitive way. 

The workbench was to be designed with an open architecture with clearly separated layers and modules to allow for future extensions. It was to be based on a number of international and industry standards to ensure the broadest range of applications, and was to meet the need for an open extendible software-based workbench that would provide an integrated set of tools covering the main activities in the CD-ROM production process.

The behaviour of the clay under isothermal conditions has been characterized. During the digging of the borehole hydromechanical expansion of the clay was observed, indicated by a drop in pore pressure.

Measurements of water contents and dry specific densities indicate an initial phase in which the clay expands followed by progressive collapse which appears to correspond to the dissipation of the pore pressures.
The heating appears to have caused irreversible deformations of the clay.

The TELEMAN 46 LACWAP research machine project aims to demonstrate a modular self-constructing long reach arm carrier structure with an advanced tele-operated light weight manipulator and gripper for intervention tasks in nuclear environments where access is only possible through restricted apertures. Such is the case in nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, where sealed chemical process cells can not be entered by human operators. The main objectives are to develop:  

- mission planning and preparation software to simulate telerobotic tasks with detailed CAD models prior to execution;  
- the self-constructing mechanism consisting of a shuttle which travels along a rack mounted on the modular long reach arm;  
-  the on-board vision system;  
-  the advanced lightweight gripper and manipulator;  
-  the gamma radiation imaging system to supply radiation field data to the CAD model.
A modular self constructing long reach arm carrier structure with an advanced teleoperated light weight manipulator and gripper (LACWAP) is being developed for intervention tasks in nuclear environments where access is only possible through restricted apertures.
An example test mission for a typical reprocessing cell has been defined, and the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) Pyramid teleoperator and work environment simulation package has been used to design the combination of modular beam, joint, and support components which will be needed to accomplish the mission. The structure has been designed to include T-junctions so that additional tools and work pieces can be stored for subsequent retrieval and use during successive stages of the test mission. The modular structure is currently being developed and constructed in parallel with the work on the light weight manipulator and gripper and the sensor and control systems. The chosen mission will include surface inspection, a gamma radiation survey, and a force controlled manipulation task. A full scale model of the work cell is being constructed at Cogema to allow testing of the integrated system.
Exploitation
The project is still in its early development stage, and is exploiting a number of building blocks from the earlier TELEMAN projects TM18 (force-reflecting gripper and manipulator) and TM22 (gamma radiation imaging system) to enhance the capabilities of a modular long reach arm developed in an independent feasibility study. Exploitation in enclosed, confined work cells such as those found in nuclear fuel re-processing plants is assured by the participation of Cogema in the project.
Work to be done  

The following modules will be developed and integrated:  
- Mission preparation software  
- Long Arm Carrier adaptation  
- Man machine interface  
- Prototype gripper with bilateral force reflective controller  
- Vision system  
- Gamma radiation imaging camera  
- CAD model integrating the teleoperated robot, the work environment, and the gamma camera data  
- Mockup of the fuel reprocessing cell  

In addition, final year student research projects will be carried out at the Universities of Ioannina, ULB Brussels, and University College Dublin.  

Test strategy  

The integrated systems will be tested in the specially constructed mock-up of the fuel reprocessing cell. The long arm carrier will proceed into the cell, self-constructing its own structure by means of the shuttle mechanism. Then the shuttle will transport into the cell the vision system, the radiation imaging camera, and the manipulator and gripper system which will be demonstrated performing a range of inspection and intervention tasks under teleoperated force-reflecting control.";;;;CSC;A T Nutech;FR;"Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas;Compagnie Générale des Matières Nucléaires (COGEMA);Espace Industrie Contrôles;Technische Universiteit Delft;Université Libre de Bruxelles;Vermaat Technics BV;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA)";"ES;FR;NL;BE";
8310;2010;NEUTRABAS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Neutral Product Definition Database for Large Multifunctional Systems;01/04/1989;31/03/1992;;"The objective of this project is to develop standardised methods for the storage and exchange of data defining shipbuilding and ocean engineering products as representative examples of large multifunctional systems.
The developments and results for a neutral product definition database for large multifunctional systems are described. The database development is based on the product modeling methodology of the evolving International Standards Organisation (ISO) standard STEP (ISO 10303) and its information modeling language EXPRESS. The main application areas envisioned for the database are ships and other maritime products as representive prototypes of large and functionally very diverse systems. The emphasis is placed on methods for describing the structural systems, the spatial arrangements, and the multitudinous outfitting systems in this type of product. The neutral database formats are intended to serve for purposes of file data exchange between heterogenous computer aided design (CAD) or computer integrated manufacture (CIM) systems as well as for data sharing by means of a dynamic access neutral database. The results of the project include concept designs and sprcifications for the product information models and for the database components.
Building on the work of ESPRIT project 322 (CAD*I) and CAD interface formats such as STEP and PDES, the project will define the principles of application-oriented reference models relating to complex maritime products, which include many services and machinery systems within a constraining steelwork envelope. 

A Neutral Product Definition Format will be defined to serve as an exchange and archiving medium for the complete standardised product definition model. In order to verify the validity of the basic principles which would be adopted in the preparation of the specification, the project will include the development of the part of the database concerned with the modelling of the steel structure, with tests simulating actual exploitation conditions. 

The availability of a neutral product definition format will encourage the development of new applications and significantly assist cooperation between the large number of designers, manufacturers and subsystem vendors typically involved in marine engineering projects. A number of software products incorporating the product definition format are expected to be exploited as a result of the development. 

It is also expected that the project will provide a valuable contribution to international standardisation in the area of product data exchange technologies and will serve as a test case for the viability of the ISO/STEP/CADI approach for complex multi-functional products.";;;;;Institut de Recherches de la Construction Navale;FR;"GESELLSCHAFT ZUR ENTWICKLUNG VON DV-METHODEN, ALGORITMEN UND PROGRAMMEN;CONSTRUNAVES;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONAL;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT BERLIN;SCHIFFKO Ingenieurleistung und CAD/CAM Service GmbH;Entwicklungszentrum für Maritime und Industrielle Technik GmbH;HOWALDTSWERKE-DEUTSCHE WERFT;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;Chantiers de l'Atlantique GEC Alsthom;MDC;Bremer Vulkan Verbund AG;INGENIERIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SISTEMAS;Cotec Computing Services;DECISION INTERNATIONAL;SENER-SISTEMAS MARINOS SA;University of Strathclyde;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);Universität Bremen";"DE;ES;FR;UK";

The main objective of the project is to link VLSI design and prototyping technologies with industrial applications, and, in parallel, to advance the state of the art within Greece through knowledge transfer between industry and academic and research institutions, as well as knowledge transfer from abroad.

With its main emphasis on the design and development of VLSI components for direct incorporation into prototypes of industrial products, the VLSI-DPE Action is examining and specifying ways of mobilising existing qualified engineering personnel and of training new engineers coming into the field. The Action will provide the necessary infrastructure and, eventually, will lead to an acceleration in the industrial take-up and application of these emerging technologies. 

The Action has been set up so that industry has the leading role in an application-specific environment, while academic institutions have a supportive (but no less significant) part to play. The deliverables of the various workpackages have direct application in the product activities of the participating SMEs. In this way both industry and academia gain the expertise required for the further improvement of VLSI technologies in Greece and hence of the country's industrial competitiveness. 

The VLSI-DPE Action is divided into two main phases: VLSI design, and VLSI prototyping. The first phase (to be carried out under the aegis of ESPRIT) encompasses all the activities involved in setting up, training personnel for and operating the IC design sub-environment. The second phase (only the definition stage of which will be carried out within ESPRIT) covers similar activities oriented towards the IC prototyping sub-environment. 

The key objectives of the VLSI-DPE project are to: 

- establish a Greek VLSI design and prototyping environment 
- assist Greek enterprises to become familiar with VLSI technologies and their advantages, and hence facilitate their more fruitful and effective collaboration with other European IC manufacturers 
- support the transfer of know-how from other European enterprises and initiatives to the Greek industrial and academic communities

In modern automated and computer integrated practice, the material logistics in the workshop become ever more important. In this context the automatic identification system plays a fundamental role in the control and management of the material flow by allowing the correct and prompt distribution of the relevant material information within the production process. This demonstration system is based on tags carrying computer generated holograms. The industrial manufacturing test bed associated with the project is described and an outline is given of the integration of the new identification system in an already existing computer integrated manufacture (CIM) environment. The holographics identification system is adaptable to different requirements and includes the following favourable features: high data capacity; low cost tags; fast and reliable read out and positioning tolerance. In HIDCIM the application of this new technology in tool identification for machining centers has been explored, but there are also other possible applications, for example, assembly lines with mixed products where each basic part has a tag with the necessary information for the different parts to be assembled.

The objective of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of holographic labelling techniques for automatic identification in a computerized industrial environment. A system based on holographic labels will have the following advantages: large data capacity; immunity to electrical, mechanical and chemical interference; simple low cost read out; wide range of reading distances; and simple, small low cost labels.
The program included the following tasks: development of holographic storage techniques, providing redundancy and permitting movement of the image and long distance readout; assessment of a low cost label material, suitable for large scale production, easy to handle, and able to withstand an industrial environment; development of the hologon disk of a write station with the ability to generate holograms; development of a read station with the ability to recognise a label, reconstruct the stored holographic pattern and decode it; and simulation of the information path from pattern generation via holographic decoding, reconstruction, interpretation and recovery of the original contents.

In the first phase these topics and managing nodes are: constraint logic programming; data and knowledge bases, language and semantics; logic programming for artificial intelligence, and transformation and analysis.
This Network's long-term objective is to develop the foundations of an integrated software environment for building knowledge-rich applications. The approach taken is to extend the logic programming paradigm by incorporating enhancements from the related areas of database systems, artificial intelligence and mathematical logic. 
The extension of logic programming has been chosen as the basis of the work both because of its sound theoretical foundations and because it has proved useful for applications in such diverse areas as programming, program specification, databases, knowledge representation and problem-solving. Logic programming also has strong relationships with other computing technologies such as functional programming, object-oriented programming and relational databases. 
The main functions of the Network will be to: 
-coordinate research activities 
-allocate and coordinate research training fellowships 
-promote the take-up of results by European industry. 
The Network will support the training of doctoral and post-doctoral researchers by providing them with an opportunity to contribute to an integrated, well-motivated, interdisciplinary programme of research, in preference to the alternative of working with an individual supervisor on an isolated problem with limited access to state-of-the-art research results. It will also provide opportunities to upgrade the skills of established academic and industrial research workers, facilitate the mobility needed for  those training activities, and integrate the results of the different nodes. Research groups in outlying areas of the European Community will be particularly encouraged to join: their participation will improve their access to state-of-the-art research f indings, enhance their ability to contribute to research, and facilitate the transfer of advanced technology to local industry. 
The Network consists of about 50 nodes; it is organised by scientific topic, with a managing node having responsibility for each topic.

The goal of this project is to develop a high voltage integrated circuit (IC) technology suitable for lamp ballast applications and to evaluate integrable components and circuits (test vehicles) for applications in a wide variety of lamp circuits up to 650 V.
The following tasks were addressed: the development of high voltage IC processes and development of models for circuit simulation; the identification of any critical behaviour related to high voltage in standard packaging structures and evaluation of materials for high voltage packages; the design of macrocells and test vehicles dedicated to lamp circuits, and evaluation of their behaviour in lamp driving applications. Within these activities the reliability evaluation of the circuits and packages was also tackled.
The technology developed within the project contributes to establishing the know how required to integrate high voltage devices with control circuits of moderate complexity. The study of materials provides a standard procedure to evaluate and compare the characteristics of different materials used in packages that have to withstand 650 V under severe ambient conditions. During the first 2 years of the SMILE project, the major effort has been dedicated to technology development. A 650 V technology, including different types of high voltage (HV) devices such as insulated gate bipolar transistors, lateral double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) and other N and P type bipolar junction transistors has been realised and macrocells designed.
Work is in progress to increase the yield and manufacturability of the technology. High reliability operation has been demonstrated for the developed technology, including packaging. Accurate models for power and signal devices to be used in circuit simulations and experimental procedures for determining and extracting the parameters of the previous models are now available.

It interacts with a database that is among the most consolidated products available. It should be emphasized that, according to the more general objectives of the KIM environment, the prototype is designed in order to enable its subsequent evolution towards the complete knowledge based integration of distributed heterogeneous environments, based on different tools managing multimedia data.

Application of neural networks for industry in Europe (ANNIE) aimed to find out which general problem areas are best approached using neural networks. Applications in pattern recognition, autonomous vehicle control and optimisation of airline crew scheduling were developed.

Specific application areas have now grown in conditioning monitoring of complex mechnisms by neural network analysis of conventional instrument data. Benefits include the following: earlier warning of failures; analysis of human signatures, leading to a socially acceptable form of automatic identification (biometrics) through automatic signature verification; analysis of finanacial transaction data to identify target classes of behaviour to allow simple quick analysis of customer preference.

A sensor device has been designed and constructed which generates 3-dimensional images of surface structures (eg after honing processes) and stores the data in a fast image memory for further automatic data evaluation.

The aim of the project was to find out which of several generic problem areas, such as pattern recognition, sensor fusion, and adaptive control and optimization, are best approached using neural networks.

A survey on the systematics and capabilities of neural networks, their architecture and applications and hardware available for neural network simulation has been performed. Areas of applications where neural networks might complete or out perform conventional techniques have been selected: image processing and inspection, robotics, optimization and technology transfer.

With respect to the inspection work, 2 problem areas related to nondestructive testing were chosen, visual inspection of solder joints and ultrasonic testing of pressure vessels. The work stimulated a large internal programme on graph matching, and now a package called MatchFinder, which enables automatic matching and comparison of gas liquid chromatography (GLC), is being marketed.
Neural networks can be of considerable help in the visualization and analysis of multivariate data. Further work has been carried out on NETVision (renamed RENDER) for use as a tool for the pharmaceutical industry to help analyse structure activity relationships in drug design.

The robotics work developed a prototype of an autonomous roving vehicle. This work has been found very useful in approaching the problem of collision avoidance.
Neural networks have also been found to be an ideal means of monitoring the oscillations of flexible structures and controlling them using a damping system based around a neural network.

Work on optimization involved an application for airline end user and crew scheduling problems. A first prototype has been produced, and the follow up work planned aims to produce a crew scheduling product. Applications in banking and finance are also planned to exploit the project's results.

Technology transfer has involved the production of a handbook and a neurocomputers and hardware bo ok should be published soon.
To do this, the partners prototyped neural network solutions in simulated problems chosen from automatic inspection, condition monitoring, robotics, control and scheduling.";;;;;United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA);UK;"British Aerospace plc;ALPHA;Artificial Intelligence;KPMG-PEAT MARWICK CONSULTANTS;Centre Technique des Industries Mécaniques (CETIM);IBP Pietzsch GmbH;Siemens AG";"UK;EL;DE;FR";

The development of the 4 experimental platforms and vision vehicle demonstrations in the VOILA project is detailed. The main vision research activities in the project are outlined and areas of research of particular importance that enabled the platforms to be established are available. The transfer of this research to the platforms has been described and the performance of the systems implemented. In particular, it has been shown how the successful transfer of some of the latest vision research to these experimental platforms and demonstrations and their implementation on multiprocessor computer systems has enabled a number of systems to be developed that provide concrete evidence that passive machine vision can provide the capabilities and performance for this type of industrial application.

The aims of the project were to carry out a collaborative programme of research on the development of flexible, dynamic vision systems and to prove their feasibility for application to a range of tasks in the operation of robot vehicles in a variety of industrial and commercial environmnets. The objectives of the vision research were to develop dynamic vision systems capable of continuous, ongoing information integration in a changing environment dealing with a variety of scenes, objects and shapes with the capacity for recognizing and locating the objects and parts of a scene of interest and, if necessary, tracking objects and features of interest as they or the camera platform are moved. Further developments involve geometric techniques that can create models of the objects and environments and use these models to support high level systems for visual path planning, object acquisition and control of the visual processing.

A number of basic visual competences involving obstacle detection, free space determination, local navigation, global map making, and object recognition, location and acquisition were developed and demonstrated on vision and vehicle experimental platforms at 4 laboratory sites within the project. 2 of these were further developed to show the potential passive vision for enhancing the capabilities of mobile vehicles in teleguided operation and in autonomous systems. A third final demonstration was used to illustrate how different vision systems and modules could be integrated on a multiprocessor distibuted environment. The fourth platform was used to demonstrate the potential of 1 of the systems developed for operation in outdoor scenes.
The objectives of the vision research carried out were to: 

- develop dynamic vision systems capable of continuous, ongoing information integration in a changing environment 
- be able to deal with a variety of scenes, objects and shapes as appropriate for the task in hand 
- develop vision systems capable of recognising and locating the objects and parts of a scene of interest for the task in hand and, if necessary, capable of tracking objects and features of interest as they or the camera platform are moved 
- develop geometric techniques that, where necessary, can create models of the objects and environments of interest, and use these models to support high-level systems for visual path planning, object acquisition and control of the visual processing 
- explore parallel implementations of the systems developed, 
- carry out a series of experiments, tests and demonstrations to assess and display the performance of the systems developed. 

Meeting these objectives required significant advances in the state of the art: in early vision and the use of stereo and motion, in the use and exploitation of predictive feed-forward techniques and dynamic vision, in the range and type of models that can be utilised in a vision system, in the design of vision system architectures and their control structures, and in the implementation of vision systems on multiprocessor environments.";;;;;GEC Marconi Ltd;UK;"MATRA;Università degli Studi di Genova;Elsag Bailey SpA;University of Sheffield;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;Roke Manor Research Ltd";"FR;IT;UK";

This, together with current demands and projections toward 0.3 micron minimum feature size, larger chips and higher placement accuracy, dictates the need for a new generation of tools for mask and reticle fabrication. The FREE project aimed at the development of a new electron-beam writing system for reticle fabrication that will answer the needs of the European IC industry for at least the next decade.
The fast reticle equipment for Europe (FREE) project aimed at the development of a new electron beam writing system for reticle fabrication that will answer the needs of the European integrated circuit (IC) industry for at least the next decade. The target specifications of the system were a throughput of 2 reticles per hour, with a minimum feature size of 1.5 micron (5x reticle), and capable for writing small test structures down to 0.2 micron. It was to attain a placement accuracy of 70 nm (0.07 micron) for 6inch reticles and critical dimension (CD) tolerance of 50 nm (0.05 micron), both at 3 sigma. 2 beam-writing strategies were followed: beam shaping techniques (ELISA), in order to speed up the writing of large features, and a gaussian electron beam system (Leica Cambridge) with increased writing speed. Both basic systems already existed from the start, but required improvements in several areas. During the project the 2 machines were upgraded to achieve the writing objectives.
A thermal field emitter source giving a higher brightness thant lanthanum boride and a 16 tungsten hairpin filament assembly with a long lifetime were designed and characterized. The design of a new column associated with high frequency detection (up to 25 MHz) was constructed and characterized. To achieve high throughput, the data rate handled by the pattern generator must be significantly improved. This was achieved by data compression techniques and higher electronic speeds for data transfer. Suitable designs were prepared in order to change the current batch loading strategy to a serial, single blank high speed handler that would be compatible with other reticle fabrication tools. Very high current densities are needed to achieve very high writing speeds. A very high sensitivity, short processing time and dry etch compatible resist has been synthesized and characterized.
At the end of the project, evaluation of both the variable shaped and gaussian beam machine against the ultimatel y desired specifications were performed. Both machines showed significant improvement over the initial configurations, offering good prospects for the consolidation of a European system capable of competing in world markets. A comparison between them revealed their strong and weak points, and plans for further improvements were presented.

- a decision-support system for the safe and economic operation of a ship and the efficient handling of equipment of growing complexity by a small crew 
- a framework for the integration of data communication and information systems in ships.

In earlier design specification phases of the project, performed within project 1074, concepts for an overall architecture for the KBS-SHIP system were drawn up. In this phase of the project the architecture will be further developed and implemented. 

The viability of the concepts will be ensured by building a prototype KBS-SHIP system incorporating a limited number of expert systems. This will include one expert system managing communications between a number of task-solving expert systems operating on a common database structure. The task-solving expert systems have been selected because of their potential contribution to cost savings and improved safety in ship operations. They will serve as decision-support tools for the optimisation of voyage plans, the preparation of maintenance schedules, alarm handling and making loading plans. Each will be supported by a system for applying ship operational regulations.

-grow epitaxially ultra-thin films of FeSi2 in its semiconducting phase on silicon 
-characterise and study these heterostructures by a number of in situ and ex situ techniques 
-examine the bandgap engineering problem with ternary semiconducting silicides (both theoretically and experimentally) 
-fabricate integrated photo-detectors.
New materials were sought for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices. Semiconducting silicides are alternative materials to compound semiconductors and organic materials. They could well provide better photodetectors, optical fibre links and on chip electrooptic interconnects. An attractive feature of the use of silicides is the wide range of possiblities for optical tuning inherent in the material.

During this research iron disilicade silicon heterostructure elaboration has received special attention. Iron disilicide in its beta semiconducting phase is a promising material because the expected energy gap is around 0.9 eV, and nicely fits the 1.5 micron optical transmission window of silica optical fibres. The following results have been obtained:
iron/silicon (III) and iron silicon (100) interface development at room temperature (these interfaces may give rise to precursor phases which control epitaxial growth at higher temperatures);
epitaxial growth of beta-iron disilide on silicon (III) and silicon (100) by various epitaxial techniques;
determination of the morphology of the films and its dependence on various elaboration parameters such as thickness and temperature;
determination of the band gap, which is about 0.9 eV;
determination of the interface structure between silicide and silicon by X-ray standing wave techniques;
determination of the theoretical ternary silicide phase diagram (iron(x) cobalt(y) silicon(z));
observation of thin beta-iron disilicide strained layers and a metallic semiconducting phase transition.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The silicides were grown on silicon substrates by solid phase epitaxy (SPE), co-evaporation techniques, chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Both the structural and electronic properties of the silicide heterostructures were to bestudied. The structural properties were characterised by: 
-glancing incidence X-ray diffraction, X-ray standing waves and extended X-ray absorption fine structures (EXAFS) 
-low and high-energy electron diffraction 
-electronic microscopy and micro-analysis 
-scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) 
-electron energy loss fine structure (EELFS) and related techniques. 
Electronic properties were characterised by: 
-UV and X-ray photoemission 
-Auger spectroscopy 
-Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy (BIS) and related techniques 
-electrical and optical characterisation techniques. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
During this Action, FeSi2-Si heterostructure elaboration has received special attention. Iron di-silicide (FeSi2) in its  semiconducting phase is a promising material because the expected energy gap is around 0.9 eV, and nicely fits the 1.5 micron optica l transmission window of silica optical fibres.

-Fe/Si(111) and (100) interface development at room temperature; these interfaces may give rise to precursor phases which control epitaxial growth at higher temperatures 
-epitaxial growth of -FeSi2 on Si(111) and Si(100) by SPE, RDE, MBE and CBE techniques 
-determination of the morphology of the films and its dependence on various elaboration parameters such as thickness and temperature

-determination of the interface structure between silicide and silicon by X-ray standing wave techniques 
-determination of the theoretical ternary silicide phase diagram (FexCoySiz). 
-observation of thin -FeSi2 strained layers and a metallic - semiconducting phase transition. 
POTENTIAL 
Successful exploitation of the tuning possibilities will lead to a breakthrough in heterostructures in silicon and related compounds, with the eventual production of better silicon-compatible photodetectors and optical fibre links. The wavelength can be tuned by using ternary silicides. 
Since the silicide fabrication techniques are compatible with current silicon technologies, the know-how obtained in this Action can be transferred immediately to development and production.";;;;;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);FR;"Università degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF ITALY;Université Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris VI";"IT;ES;FR";

execution times for a wide range of applications, through the use of parallelism;
the cost of computation, through the exploitation of very large scale integration (VLSI) technology;
the cost of producing computer software, by the development of methods and tools.

The results fall into 4 categories: system architecture, language, user interfaces and the design methods and applications. On the system side, the POOMA prototype was further evaluated. The layout of the communication processor chip was produced and the node was also redesigned to allow a greater integration of the machine. The first components of the envisaged communication server was produced and the boards to interconnect to integrated services digital network (ISDN) and fibre distributed data interface (FDDI) were tested.
The object oriented language POOL was further developed and implemented on the POOMA machine.
The work on the database system progressed toward the development of a multimedia distributed database server. An extended structured query language (SQL) and the implementation of abstract data types and complex objects were worked on, and first implementations were demonstrated. To develop applications on the parallel system, design tools were constructed that allow a developer to conceive the application in an object oriented manner and experiment with the granularity of the parallelism to get the best performance. Generic tools to construct user interfaces to applications were also developed and implemented.
On the application side, the major achievement has been the geographic application. It aimed to provide a parallel geographic data server allowing the user to ask complex queries on maps and early prototypes have been successfully demonstrated.
TROPICS aimed to research and develop a symbolic, parallel computer system technology to meet the high-performance demands of symbolic applications that constitute the next step forward in office automation, and in other fields. This will be expressed in the delivery of an industrial prototype of a parallel processing system, using the object-oriented approach for exploiting parallelism. 

Work-packages were planned for the following tasks: 

- defining the architecture of the processing node and its constituent components, followed by VLSI designs and implementations for the components 
- the design and implementation of the parallel processing units and their integration into a complete TROPICS systems 
- designing and implementing the TROPICS operating system 
- designing and implementing support software to provide a platform on which applications can be developed 
- making available the object-oriented programming language POOL as the TROPICS main programming language, other languages to offer a migration path, and a set of software development tools

PUMA is complementary to the GENESIS projects (numbers 2427 and 2702), and has links with SUPERNODEII (2528).
Performance evaluation results and ensuing recommendations for the design and architecture of future transputer based networks for scalable, universal message passing machines have been collected. The main method used for the investigations was the simulation of network and load models on the packet level, partly extended by a novel combination with analytical models. 3 important steps of performance evaluation and their results have been evaluated. In the first step, sustained random communication performance is evaluated with respect to the predicition of throughput and delay, their variation with the network size and cost relative comparison of the different topologies. In the second step, various routing schemes are investigated for their performance effects on different load patterns.

8234;1666;CEDISYS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Concurrent Distributed Systems;15/04/1989;14/03/1992;;"One of the problems with the usual formal semantics of concurrency is that it does not reflect the way in which processes are concurrently composed. CEDISYS aims to develop a theory of concurrency in which the distributed nature of processes is properly taken into account (ie truly concurrent semantics). 
In addition, the Action planned to develop appropriate models, languages and logics; these will be compositional or syntax-directed in order to support top-down development of programs. They will also support abstraction. The Action also experimented withtechniques and tools for supporting the implementation and animation of the proposed formalisms.
A fundamental understanding of the nature of concurrency and a formal framework for describing concurrent and distributed systems were developed. The framework should lead to methodologies for proving systems correct and, more generally, for deriving their properties.

A web of strong formal connections has been developed, expressed as reflections and coreflections in categorical terms, among a number of simple transition based models. A new model for describing the operational semantics of parallel processes, the Chemical Absract Machine, was introduced. It is well suited for a semantics based on the notion of reduction.

In the categorical approach, computations of a transition system appear to be equipped with a rich algebraic structure.

APPROACH AND METHODS 
Of the various models of concurrent distributed behaviour proposed, CEDISYS employed two as the preferred semantic domain: Petri-nets and event structures. Using algebraic and categorical techniques, Petri-nets have been extended with compositional and observational mechanisms. 
Process description languages originally defined for the interleaving approach (in which a computation is viewed as a sequence of interleaved events) will be equipped with truly concurrent semantics by adapting structural operational semantics and algebraic techniques. Several notions of testing and observational equivalence of processes are being introduced and compared. The issue of the atomicity of actions (the property of being decomposable but non-interruptible) and of action refinement are being studied as well, with the objective of providing process description languages for hierarchical system design and specification. 
Reasoning about distributed systems is an important goal in many computer science applications. Modal and temporal logical languages are being used in this Action to do this. The close relationships between particular behavioural equivalences and assertion languages are being recorded by stating which results in one theory can be adequately expressed in the other. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
A web of strong formal connections has been developed, expressed as reflections and co-reflections in categorical terms, among a number of simple transition-based models. A chapter by Nielsen & Winskel in the forthcoming Handbook of Logic in Computer Science will show the complete picture. A new model for describing the operational semantics of parallel processes, the Chemical Abstract Machine, was introduced. It is well-suited for a semantics based on the notion of reduction. 
In the categorical approach, computations of a transition system appear to be equipped with a rich algebraic structure. Petri-nets can be conveniently handled in this way, and their arrows turn out to be isomorphic to concatenable variants of Petri nonsequential processes. Similarly, when the concurrent transition system of the lambda-calculus is considered, its arrows coincide with the classes of Levy's permutation equivalence. The constructions can be generalised using the concepts of internal graph andcategory. The theory can be applied to logic programming. 
A refined version of observation for CCS has been introduced which allows the observer to see the distributed nature of processes. It is shown that the resulting theory of location equivalence can be characterised by a simple modal logic. A comparison wit h distributed bisimulation is also given. An alternative to defining a particular noninterleaving semantics is to develop parametric constructions. An equational characterization of bisimulation equivalence has been introduced, which is parametric on the actual algebra of observations. Allowed observations contain interesting special cases, like spatial pomsets. A good level of generality is also achieved by proved trees (essentially causal trees with proved transitions). 
A language of communication, restriction and recursion is defined, which contains a notion of action refinement related to the ST-operational semantics. The idea is to view a non-atomic action as a pair of related actions, namely the beginning and the end . A compositional proof system has been defined based on a category of labelled transition systems. Assertions are formulae in a modal mu-calculus. The method consists of applying a sequence of reductions, transforming satisfaction problems for composite process into equivalent satisfaction problems for their immediate subcomponents. The approach yields the most efficient local model checking algorithm published. 
POTENTIAL 
Most of the existing practical methodologies and tools based on interleaving models of concurrency could be transferred to the true concurrency context. However, a more substantial breakthrough is possible, as completely new methods and tools will become feasible, taking advantage of the superior descriptive power of true concurrency. They will provide the ground for direct improvements in at least three areas: design methods for distributed systems; expert systems designed for reasoning about time; and the architecture of distributed systems.";;;;;Università degli Studi di Pisa;IT;"AARHUS UNIVERSITET;Institut National de Recherches en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA);UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX";"DK;FR;UK";
8280;2486;DYNAMO;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Integrated CAE Techniques for Dynamic Analysis of Structures;01/05/1989;28/02/1993;;"The objective of this project was to develop a technology platform for structural dynamic analysis that integrates fatigue analysis and acoustic radiation prediction with vibration analysis.
Acoustic radiation, dynamic fatigue and vibrations are frequently interrelated aspects in the structural dynamics optimization of cars. Realistic assessment of these phenomena is only possible after development of first prototypes at a stage where large design modifications are only implemented at considerable expense. For acoustic radiation prediction, techniques based on the boundary element method (BEM) are promising but several aspects remain to be improved: the solution to the coupled fluid structure problem, modelling of specific boundary conditions and proper simulation of excitation. Methodology for traditional fatigue analysis is well developed for predictions based on crack initiation, but less for the crack growth case. The methodology is applied at the stage when first prototypes are available. The underlying relation between fatigue and structural vibrations is rarely developed at all, even in the prototype optimization phase. As a consequence, the effect of structural dynamics modifications on the fatigue behaviour is not understood. The project develops improved methods for acoustic radiation prediction and fatigue analysis, including the relation with structure vibration models. The technology is implemented in a computer assisted engineering (CAE) software architecture that is designed for UNIX computer workstations. Progress was made in each of the addressed technology domains: improved crack initiation and crack growth based fatigue analysers; extended element types, boundary conditions and acoustic sources for acoustic radiation prediction and improved operating vibration data analysis techniques. The basic methodology for integratingstructural modelling with both fatigue analysis and noise prediction was spelled out and the development initiated. For fatigue analysis, this mainly involves the modelling and quantification of the effect of resonance induced strains on the lifetime, enabling the prediction of appropriate design modifications. For a coustic radiation, this involves the coupling of the structural models with the acoustic BEM models. A prototype integration, including all required interfaces, was realised. An extensive test program, to relate modelling with experimental results for a set of laboratory systems was defined and initiated. The definition of the required open system architecture, based on a standardised user interface approach was completed and the development of the necessary platform building blocks started.
The prototype of the platform software is targeted at engineering workstations, using advanced user interfaces and data management techniques, with interfaces to existing CAD and FEM systems and to experimental analysis programs for vibration analysis data. The integrated platform allows interaction between designers and experimenters at an early stage in the design process. The project aimed to achieve: 

- the extension of fatigue life estimation methods and their integration with vibration analysis and test 
- the extension of acoustic radiation prediction techniques and their integration with vibration analysis and test 
- the development of technical modelling techniques with respect to fatigue analysis and acoustic radiation prediction and their integration with geometric modelling 
- the enhancement of vibration analysis techniques in view of specific requirements for fatigue analysis and acoustic radiation prediction. 

Developments have been validated in conjunction with major manufacturers in the automotive industry. 

Exploitation 

The methodology and tools developed will have important applications in the automotive and aerospace industries and in the mechanical engineering industry in general. The following benefits are expected: 

- superior products in terms of improved dynamic characteristics (reduced vibration and noise emission, improved fatigue life) 
- shortened design cycles, since products with improved dynamic characteristics will require less prototype testing and trouble shooting in later phases of the design process 
- higher degree of flexibility, as an improved understanding of the dynamics of the product will enable the prediction of the effects of design changes and the forecasting of the performance of variations of a new product (eg cars with different engines, gear transmissions, etc).

The components in question are those concerned with: 

- product development 
- production planning 
- production control 
- process coordination 
- process monitoring and control 
- process interface.
A software management and configuration system has been developed. It describes a software application as a parts list of all its components by using a self defined software engineering environment (SEE) model. The underlying version and variant management is done by a UNIX standard tool.
A prototype was made available on 02/04/92
The operating environment is as follows :
Operating system: UNIX, INFORMIX database management system (DBMS)
A number of applications from these fields will be developed or adapted and will be installed in selected industrial and laboratory test-beds. 

The tools will be applicable to both the discrete parts manufacturing and continuous and discontinuous process industries. 

The following tools will be developed: 

- Interface Management System (INMAS): an individually configurable software interface supporting data exchange between different CIM applications. This tool consists mainly of two components: a communication control management module and a general information management and control component. To access data INMAS uses a neutral interface based on SQL called gateway. 
- Configuration System (COSY): this will support the individual configuration of software systems at application, functional and data structure level. A COSY tool will further manage program version and release information. 
- Distributed Database (DDB): this will allow CIM applications to access databases or files resident on physically remote systems as if they were local. Gateways needed by INMAS will be also a result of DDB activities. 
- Man-Machine Interface (MMI): starting from a previous ESPRIT project this will provide tools supporting the automatic creation of graphical user interfaces. Another goal of MMI is the definition of a common user interface across the range of systems and applications of CIDAM.

The main objective of the project is to support the functional specifications of and standards for integrated broadband communications (IBC) maintenance by developing appropriate technology. The complexity of future IBC networks leads to new requirements which will benefit from the use of advanced infrastructure planning (AIP) techniques. Within the overall objective, guidelines and evaluation criteria will be developed for use in IBC maintenance. Guidelines will also take account of the particular man machine interface (MMI) requirements for maintenance.
A generic knowledge representation structure for telecommunication networks and maintenance knowledge has been improved and applied to 2 existing networks. Improved tools for knowledge representation and acquisition, for inference on the knowledge representation, and for MMI and infrastructure have been specified and implemented as prototypes. The tools are integrated into the generic maintenance system (GMS) prototype. Maintenance application prototypes for 2 existing networks (BERKOM and System X) have been implemented. A network scenario based on projections to IBC has been specified to form the basis for a further maintenance application prototype. Cooperation between maintenance and other telecommunication management network (TMN) components has been studied.
Technical Approach  

The main technical approach will involve three separate but inter-dependent tracks within the consortium.  The first track will evaluate exiting digital network maintenance and enhance and generalise these capabilities for IBC requirements.  A common knowledge representation for the physical and functional structure of the network and for the diagnosis and repair tasks will be developed. The second track will develop generic AIP maintenance systems and techniques.  These techniques will be evaluated early on existing network applications and later on projections to IBC requirements.  The third track will be directly involved with the emerging IBC specifications and reference model and will contribute to the definition of IBC maintenance specifications and standards.  

Key issues  

- Uniform knowledge representation across TMN.  
- MMI for providing appropriate operator support.  
- Integration of distributed maintenance sub-systems.  
- Completeness and consistency of large distributed DB/KB.  
- Real time maintenance capabilities.  
- AIP standards for maintenance.  
- Standards and guidelines for TMN and for IBC maintenance.

The experience achieved with the prototype work will be of great value in selecting AIP techniques and tools to build real systems.

By the definition of different control levels of sophistication, the application spectrum ranges from low cost controllers up to complex motion controllers for redundant robot kinematics. Modularity and flexible configurability of the control architecture is ensured by the use and preparation of standardized external interfaces, bus systems, communication protocols and internal interface descriptions.

The IDEFIX project has developed a methodology for the determination of modular fixtures for prismatic workpieces. This methodology has been implemented in a software tool, namely the IDEFIX system.

Given the workpiece description in the form of features, the IDEFIX system determines the minimum number of set ups needed to machine the workpiece. For each set up, it determines the positioning, supporting and clamping locations in contact with the workpiece (the so called virtual fixture) and finally it designs the physical fixture based on modular fixturing elements.

Within the IDEFIX project another methodology and the corresponding software tool have been developed for the technical economical justification of the use of the modular fixturing system for a given enterprise.

Some further developments are necessary to produce a fully operational system in industrial environments. Efficient interfaces should be developed to retrieve the workpiece information from a computer assisted design (CAD) system.
The T9 module which takes care of the determination of the physical fixture once the virtual fixture has been determineed by the previous modules, is the closest to commercialization.

The use of modular systems can result in a quicker responsiveness to the market demands and in a reduction of the inventory cost of fixturing equipment. In spite of these intangible benefits many companies hesitate to invest in modular systems due to a lack of a generalised method to compare the economical benefits of modular systems with regard to dedicated systems. In the project a methodology was developed and implemented in a spreadsheet that will assist the user in the economical justification of an investment in modular systems. 

The relevant information needed for the design and building of the fixtures was determined. 

A methodology to determine the needed number of set ups and the distribution of the manufacturing features over these set ups was developed. 

A methodology to design a functional fixture (so called virtual fixture) was developed. This meant determining the necessary features which can be used for positioning, clamping and supporting. 
A methodology to define the final physical fixture corresponding to the designed functional fixture (so called virtual fixture) were developed. Fixturing features are used to represent modular fixturing systems. The result is validated by industrial experience. 

The economical benefits of investing in modular fixtures were analysed. This meant convincing a potential user of the advantages of using modular systems in fixturing, and justifying the investment in modular fixtures.
The major tasks, which represent significant advances on current fixturing and planning methods, will be : 

- the development of methods for the selection of workpiece setups and the design of fixtures, based on modular fixturing systems; 

- the introduction of these methods in a computer programme, totally integrated with the existing CAD and CAM software of the industrial partners;

Technical Approach  

The project addresses the development of an advanced, cost-effective, digital tape recording technology for HDTV in which the recording of standard TV is also included.  Effort will be concentrated on the development of a digital recording system providing high recording densities and channel bit rates of up to 100 Mbit/s, requiring a channel capacity about ten times that achieved in current analogue consumer video recorders. Bit-rate reduction techniques for magnetic tape recording will be used to reduce the HDTV distribution bit-rate from about 1000 Mbit/s to a channel recording bit-rate of 100 Mbit/s or lower. Because of the requirement for multi-speed operation of the recorder and because recording-channel error characteristics are very different from those of the transmission channel, the corresponding bit-rate reduction requirements are quite different.  Therefore, the work on bit-rate reduction for magnetic recording must be undertaken separately from that on video coding for transmission, which is b ing undertaken in project R1018, HIVITS.  In order to guarantee consistency of coding, liaison with the consortium undertaking that project must be maintained.  

Key Issues  

- Development of a recording channel providing a high bandwidth and a high recording density.  
- Development of cost-effective high-precision recording mechanics which provide a high track density.  
- Elaboration of bit-rate reduction techniques for TV and HDTV, appropriate for magnetic recording.  
- Realisation of a DVT demonstrator.  

Achievements  

In the first three years of the project most effort was spent on the separate technologies needed for building up the background knowledge and on the integration into a data recorder.  In year four the decision was made to change some basic parameters to enhance the realisation of a HDTV-recorder which can be used for demonstrations outside a laboratory environment.  The expertise built up in the first three years and the results of the experiments with the new basic parameters resulted in year four in the definition of a better system concept and a new tape format.  Considerable improvements have been achieved on the system elements.  The realisation of the final HDTV demonstrator has been started and should be completed by end of 1992.

The EURONUT European Community (EC) concerted action studies the interrelationship of diet in health and disease as Europe offers large variations in both dietary patterns and in morbidity and mortality patterns.

Nutrition and the elderly in Europe:
Data regarding nutrient and food intakes, diet habits, diet awareness, nutritional status, health and lifestyle factors were collected and partially presented. There was considerable variability from site to site (even within countries) in dietary intake, in both quantity and composition; blood biochemistries; lifestyle factors; health; and performance. Implications of the observed wide variability will be studied longitudinally.

Surveillance of dietary habits with regard to cardiovascular disease:
Despite sometimes great cultural differences all participating countries, with the exception of China on some points, show a nutrient intake which is largely deviating from a diet recommended for the prevention of chronic disease: rather high in energy, high in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and relatively low in complex carbohydrates.

Nutrition, body fat distribution and health risks:
Indicators of fat distribution were related to cardiovascular risk factors, usually independent of body mass index. The clearest associations were observed for waist circumference and waist thigh ratio on the one hand and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides and insulin levels on the other. In women increased abdominal fat mass is associated with increased androgenicity but this was less clear in men. Gender differences in fat distribution may be responsible for the differences in HDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides between men and women.

The growth and development of children:
The study involves the development and execution of a longitudinal study in children aged 0 to 3 years. In this concerted action the methodological basis for this study was discussed, developed and tried out.
Since 1982 a European Community Concerted Action on Nutrition and Health has been pursued among European countries. This action was initiated by the Commission of the European Communities and was supervised by the EC/DG XII Committees on Epidemiology (COMAC-EPID) and Bio-Medical and Health Research.
Prompted by the greying of the European Society, and the necessity to maintain good health and performance at older age with nutrition as an important contributing factor, the Project Management Group of EURONUT in 1986 decided to embark on a study of nutritional problems and needs that older people experience. In 1987 and 1988 several meetings were held to develop a common protocol and to discuss the design of the study, selection of participants, data collection and the standardization of procedures. All details have been described in one of the EURONUT reports. In 1988 the European-wide multicenter study, named EURONUT-SENECA, was started to explore cross-cultural differences in nutritional issues, life-style factors, health and performance of European elderly people. At present, EURONUT-SENECA provides baseline data necessary for the appraisal of the nutrition and health situation of elderly people in Europe. It also provides a solid base for longitudinal study in which specific hypotheses of healthy aging can be tested.

This EURONUT EC Concerted Action has given specific attention to the following four concerted action sub-programmes:

B) Surveillance of Dietary Habits with regard to Cardiovascular Diseases: MONICA-WHO-EURONUT;

The main strategic objective of this project is to enhance the current generation of computer-based trainers (CBTs) and simulators for industrial applications through the use of intelligent tutoring systems (in general) and qualitative modelling techniques (in particular). 

The main technical objective is to develop a generic architecture for Intelligent Training Systems in Industrial Environments (ITSIE) that allows the domain to be modelled in several ways and presented in the form most appropriate to the user and the task to be learned. The domain modelling consists of both representations of expertise, either in the form of associations or procedures and explicit models of the physical system using numerical and qualitative simulation techniques. The tutor will be represented by a set of primitive instructional strategies reflecting the range of pedagogic approaches to tutoring necessary for the industrial domain. This provides an enhanced architecture for training systems that will greatly extend the capability of current CBTs. 

This project will be in two phases. The first will establish the requirements for the demonstrator applications for ITSIES, utilising both qualitative and quantitative models. This will lead to the development of a set of tools to implement the identified modules. 

The second phase will develop two working demonstrators to validate and refine the tools:

This should serve as a sound non-objectionable basis to sustain the development of public health on this key aspect of the tobacco smoking issue.

The major specific objective is a quantitative estimation, obtained with improved methodology, of exposure assessment and study design in respect to already existing studies of lung cancer in nonsmokers. Ancillary objectives are the evaluation of the relationship between ETS and cancers other than lung in adults and children, as well as chronic obstructive lung disease and lung function impairments in adult nonsmokers.
Research is being carried out in order to provide, on the basis of European data, an estimate of the disease burden from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in Europe. The quantitative estimation of exposure assessment will be obtained through improved methodology and study design in respect to already existing studies of lung cancer in nonsmokers. 

The data collection started in 1989. Data on cases and controls are being edited, and incorporated into an international database for analysis. By the end of 1992 the recruitment was increased on average by 50%. Through conservative estimates of the likely intake of cases of lung cancer in nonsmokers has been made in the planning phase, it has become clear that the proportion of nonsmokers is (even in females) in most centres lower than expected. The provisional diagnosis of lung cancer for smokers who are recruited and interviewed as such for the study, is later histologically confirmed in a large proportion of the cases. For nonsmokers the proportion of confirmed cases is much lower, of say 50% or less. In other words, the exposure status (being a smoker) is a powerful predictor of a correct diagnosis. Because of the comparatively low proportion of confirmations among nonsmokers, the rate of accrual of lung cancers in nonsmokers is lower than predicted or expected. This provides an instructive example of how even a group of investigators, almost all with substantial previous experience of case control studies on a variety of cancers, may still, after having explicitly considered the issue on the basis of their preceding experience, materially underestimate the rate of accrual of cases in a study.

An international study was set up to look at the epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection, low levels of serum pepsinogen A (indicative of severe chronic atrophic gastritis) and lymphocytic alkyl deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts and to relate these biological entities to the occurrence of gastric cancer worldwide. 

There was a statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity and log cumulative rates for both gastric cancer mortality (coefficient = 2.68, probability = 0.001) and incidence (coefficient = 1.79, probability = 0.002). There was also a highly significant association between the percentage prevalence of low serum pepsinogen A levels (less than 25 ng/ml) and gastric cancer rates in males (coefficients 0.43 (probability = 0.006) for mortality and 1.001 (probability = 0.0001) for incidence) but not in females. The prevalence of methyl DNA adducts in 55 to 64 year old nonsmokers was significantly higher in centres with a high risk of gastric cancer in comparison with those with a low risk (12.3% versus 1.1% probability less than 0.0001). 

H. pylori seropositivity was more common in the 55 to 64 year age group than in the 25 to 34 year age group (62.4% versus 34.9%) and in subjects with a lower standard of education (61.6% versus 46.9% in those with secondary education and 34.1% in those with a higher education). There was no difference between men and women and seropositivity was not related to tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption. There was a strong correlation between the prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity and low pepsinogen A levels in the 55 to 64 age group at the population level (correlation = 0.79, probability versus 0.001).
In order to examine the epidemiology of chronic gastritis with atrophy and its association with gastric cancer, an ecological study, EUROGAST, was organised using these markers as a Concerted Action of the European Community Medical and Health Research Programme IV.

The original objectives of the EUROGAST study were:
1 To investigate the variability in serum pepsinogen A and C levels and the presence of serum IgG antibodies to H.pylori in representative samples of 12 geographically defined populations throughout Europe.
2 To examine the degree of association between the incidence and mortality from gastric cancer and the levels of serum pepsinogens and the prevalence of H.pylori antibodies.
3 To examine the extent and variability of the formation of alkyl-DNA adducts in peripheral lymphocytes and to relate the presence of adducts to gastric cancer rates and, within each population, to the presence of serologically defined atrophic gastritis (defined using pepsinogen levels).

The study was subsequently extended firstly by including additional populations in non-EC Europe, Africa, Japan and the US. This was to extend the range in cancer risk within the study populations. Secondly an additional objective became evident during the study:
4 To establish a biological resource of blood fractions, from different defined populations, collected, processed and stored under standardised conditions with accompanying socio-demographic data and comparable vital statistics about cancers of the stomach, colon, oesophagus, lung, breast (female) and prostate.";;;;CON;Imperial Cancer Research Fund;UK;;;
8621;2102;COMIS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Standard for Coding Moving Images on Digital Storage Media;01/03/1989;31/12/1991;;"COMIS aimed to define an efficient video coding algorithm and a conceptual design of the LSI which would allow implementation of a simple decoder for office and home applications, capable of accessing moving-image information recorded on a variety of digital storage media. The availability of a standard would spur a wide range of applications in different areas, such as entertainment, education, and training, as well as in the office.
Coding moving images on digital storage media (COMIS) is directly related to International Standards Organisation (ISO) activities for the definition of a standard for the coded representation of moving image information on digital storage media, and provides a support for coordinated European participation and proposals. The project is made possible by the concurrent evolution of some key technologies such as those of digital storage, video coding and very large scale integration (VLSI).

The aim of the standard for coding moving images on digital storage (COMIS) project was to define an efficient video coding algorithm and a conceptual design of the large scale integration (LSI) which would allow implementations of a simple decoder for office and home applications, capable of accessing moving image information recorded on a variety of digital storage media.

COMIS has made a significant contribution to an International Standard Organization (ISO) Draft International Standard entitled Coding of Moving Pictures and Associated Audio for Digital Storage Media up to about 1.5 Mbit/s, and has produced the following additional results:
a simulation model yielding good quality coded pictures;
a hardware reference model for the successive phases of conceptual very large scale integration (VLSI) design;
the specification of a real time demonstrator able to decode ISO Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) audiovisual sequences at a bit rate of about 1 Mbit/s;
the demonstration of a real time terminal playing 30 in of audiovisual material coded and multiplexed according to the ISO/MPEG standard and stored on a multimedia workstation based on a personal computer, PC/AT.

Work is now in progress on producing 30 min of audiovisual material coded according to the ISO MPEG standard and stored on a multimedia workstation.
The goals of the project were to: 

- define an algorithm for the efficient coding of moving pictures for digital storage media having the following properties: 

. target throughput rate of 1-1.5 Mbit/s, typical of the most common digital storage media such as compact disc and DAT 
. high picture quality 
. compatible with telecommunication standards (CCITT Recommendation H.261 for videoconferencing and visual telephony) 

- define the conceptual VLSI design of the chips implementing the standard

The principal objective is to establish scientific basis of the agrobiological system in order to clearly delimit the typical input and output.  Other goals are to improve current techniques and to disseminate these techniques in the Agricultural World.  Most of the techniques used in OF will be potentially used by others and so this research will show a valid way for the European Agriculture.
The object of the project was to establish a scientific basis for organic farming systems, with a clear definition of typical inputs and corresponding outputs. The field experiments which have been completed were concerned with the following crops and corresponding investigations: weed and pest control in alfalfa; varieties of fababean; biostimulants for maize and fodder beet; varieties and crop protection for potatoes and field beans; varieties, seeding modes and rates for rye, winter wheat and winter oats; association of spring barley and oat with pea; varieties, rhizobium effectiveness, and weed control in sainfoin; and use of green manures. The effects of organic fertilizers have been studied on legumes and barley, haymaking trials to compare mixtures of species have been carried out and a first economic analysis made of potato production. Analysis of the production experiments is continuing. On 2 plots in Belgium and Ireland where the land is being converted to organic farming, the base level of soil fertility (major and minor elements, biological fertility), earthworm activity and weed flora were established at the beginning and are now monitored regularly.
More precisely, following topics are studied :  

a) Economical aspects : to investigate about the data concerning costs of the methods recommended in OF Evaluate the gross margins of several crops.  
b) Weed control : to establish new approaches and to improve current methods.  
c) Soil fertility and plant nutrition : to describe and ultimately be able to anticipate the different aspects of the dynamic of fertilizing elements in OF fields.  
d) Varietal aspects : to determine the best adapted varieties for selected farming systems.  
e) Reconversion : to identify parameters to be taken into account in the course of reconversion from 'classical' towards OF.

The objective of the project is to develop a low cost local loop and switch technology which is capable of supporting a range of narrowband and broadband services in a flexible and efficient manner. The project is system led and vertically integrated so that the key dependent technologies can be considered in an overall system context. The experimental activities are actively supported by a theoretical workpackage which determines not only the requiremnets of broadband local network technology (BLNT), but also looks at the wider broadband system aspects.

Technical Approach  

The project is system led and vertically integrated so that the key dependent technologies can be considered in an overall system context.  This provides the basis for ensuring a realistic proving environment for the components being developed within the project.  The components are, where possible, being developed to fit into a number of various system and access architectures. The experimental activities are actively supported by a theoretical workpackage which determines not only the requirements of BLNT, but also looks at the wider broadband system aspects.  

BLNT consists of two major demonstrators: an experimental switch model and a customer access connection.  The experimental switch model has been completed and tested and the customer access will reach a similar stage early in 1992.  

The major functions of a full speed, CCITT compatible switch have been designed and built and tested as a model.  The tests carried out initially were limited by the availability of suitable traffic generating equipment.  However, these have been able to verify the overall functioning of the switch system and show that the major concepts on which the switch is based are valid.  The results of this work have provided invaluable experience and feedback and will form the basis for future development leading to the introduction of broadband systems.  

The project has also produced a series of CAC prototypes based on opto-electronic integrated circuits (OEIC) and VLSI developed by the project.  The ultimate target is for a two chip opto-electronic integrated circuit for the transmitter, receiver and wavelength duplexer, which will significantly reduce the price of the customer access. The model for the customer access is planned to be complete by early '92.  This will comprise two  sub- demonstrators, ie a multiplexing sub-demonstrator based on the CCITT Synchronous Digital Hierarchy for which all the components have been designed and produced within the project and the optical link sub-demonstrator which comprises opto-electronic modules for the NT and LT ends of the customer link.  As with the experimental model significant system and technology experience has been gained in this area and components have developed to suit a number of different scenarios.  

The switch and the customer access parts of the projects have defined a common interface, such that the two halves of the project can be readily integrated.  This work which is outside the scope of BLNT is planned to be a part of the BUNI Demonstrator project and both demonstrators will therefore be made available for this purpose.

During its initial phase, the main objectives were to study and assess the effects of several signal processing operations upon the transmission performance of optical and cordless links, used in an integrated broadband customer premises network for IBC.  

More recently, special attention has been devoted to those signal processing techniques offering the higher prospects for economical deployment of IBC services. One such technique is sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). The main objective of the work is to specify, design, simulate and contribute towards the optimisation of sub-carrier multiplexing systems.  These systems are intended for use in the customer access connection as currently developed by R1030-ACCESS.

Special attention has also been devoted to those signal processing techniques offering higher prospects for economical deployment of IBC services. One such technique is subcarrier multiplexing (SCM). The main objective of the work was to specify, design, simulate and contribute towards the optimization of subcarrier multiplexing systems.

The research has resulted in the following achievements:
the development of analytical and software tools for the simulation of digital transmission channels, incorporating (in a user definable manner), the effects of scrambling and/or line coding, channel degradations, bandwidth limitations, direct current (DC) wandering, equalization behaviour, etc;
the development of analytical and software tools for the assessment of the effects of channel length variation on transmission system behaviour;
the development of analytical and computational tools to support the specification, design, simulation and optimization of subcarrier multiplexing systems for the customer access connection network.
Technical Approach  

The methods and procedures adopted to achieve the above objectives are basically the following:  

. Collection and elaboration of relevant information available in the literature.  Data is interpreted and combined into conclusions meaningful to the project.  
. Analysis of technical options by careful estimation, calculation and experimental testing.  
. Modelling and simulation.  Where appropriate models exist (or can be created), simulation techniques are used to obtain the characteristics of components, sub-systems or techniques.  
. Experimental research and development of new techniques.  

Following an initial phase when the project was mostly addressing the CPN environment, for the last two . years attention has turned to the customer access connection (CAC) as defined by project R1030 (ACCESS). A collaboration agreement was established between R1030 and R1052 with the support of RCO, to reinforce and facilitate articulation between the two projects. R1052 has devoted increased attention to some of the issues associated with the analogue technique of sub- carrier multiplexing, being the central architecture under consideration within ACCESS.  Particular care is devoted to the implications of receiver reproducibility and cost.  

The results of R1052 can be made available to other relevant RACE projects, on request.  

Key Issues  
Signal processing, in the context of this project, has been used with two quite different meanings:  

. In the CPN environment it referred to such operations as equalisation, detection, line coding and/or scrambling, packetisation (eg STM or ATM).  
. In the CAC environment it has been referring mainly to the operations associated with sub-carrier multiplexing systems (SCM).  

Achievements  
. Development of analytical and software tools for the simulation of digital transmission channels, incorporating (in a user definable manner), the effects of scrambling and/or line coding, channel degradations, bandwidth limitations, DC wandering, equalisation behaviour, etc.  This also has the possibility of quantifying such aspects as eye diagram penalties, jitter, etc.  
. Development of analytical and software tools for the assessment of the effects of channel length variation on transmission system behaviour.  For a certain line code or framing structure (eg STM), this is capable of optimising the receiver equaliser, given the limits of variation of the channel length.  
. Development of analytical and computational tools to support the specification, design, simulation and optimisation of sub-carrier multiplexing systems for the customer access connection network.  

Expected Impact  
The provision of cost-effective solutions for IBC requires that the cost of both the customer connection and the distribution network within customer premises should be as low as possible.  Signal processing techniques can have a major impact on the cost and efficiency of transmission systems by overcoming some of the media limitations and allowing the use of simple and robust equipment at a low-cost level.";;;;;University of Aveiro;PT;;;

Such a hypothesis can only be demonstrated within the context of a complete vision system, in which the potential benefits of continuous control of perception and of associated temporal context are evident. The goal of this Action was to adapt and refine existing vision techniques and to integrate them as a first step towards a general-purpose vision system.
The integration of basic techniques for the construction of a continuously operating vision system capable of interpreting a dynamically changing environment was studied, concentrating on the control of perception via the goal directed focus of attention. The approach used spatial and temporal context, multiple resolutions and controlled motion of the sensor system.

A standard system architecture, which facilitates centralized and distributed control, has been suggested and implemented in a skeleton software system. The system includes a standard module architecture which can be replicated at all levels of the system. The software system provides extensive support for this module architecture, so that it permits easy integration of visual modules.

The integrated skeleton system includes new developments of a controllable stereo camera head (mounted on a robot arm), generation of multiresolution pyramids for image representation, line extraction, linking and tracking. These operations are performed by newly developed special VME hardware for operation at 10 Hz.

Visual modules for detailed image description and grouping, 3 dimensional description, geometric 3-dimensional modelling of the scene, scene interpretation and control of perception have been developed in a skeleton version and integrated into the system.

A final version of the system that is capable of doing continuous goal directed active vision and symbolic description of the content of a dynamic scene has been demonstrated. The functionality is still limited to a small application domain, but generic methods have to a large extent been applied and extensions may thus easily be incorporated.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Techniques to interpret a dynamically changing, quasi-structured environment were developed. These techniques used goal-directed focus-of-attention methods involving controlled sensor motion. Processing was directed by goals which change in response to the demands of the perceptual task, as well as in reaction to events in the scene. This approach is directed towards limiting the computational complexity of the perception process by restricting the size of the internal models employed. These models must be continuously updated to describe the environment in terms of a number of qualitatively different phenomena, such as image phenomena themselves, three-dimensional scene geometry, and symbolic interpretation of objects and events. 
The necessary techniques were to be developed in the context of an integrated vision system, which will serve as a means of testing the fundamental hypothesis. 
The research issues addressed include: 
-the role of contexts and goals in the control of perception 
-the use of multiple resolution representation of two- and three-dimensional shapes 
-the description at multiple levels of abstraction. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
After the third year of the Action, the construction phase concerning an initial prototype for a vision system has been completed: 
-A standard system architecture, which facilitates centralised and distributed control, has been suggested and implemented in a skeleton software system. The system includes a standard module architecture which can be replicated at all levels of the syst em. The software system provides extensive support for this module architecture, so that it permits easy integration of visual modules contributed by the various partners of the Action. 
-The integrated skeleton system includes new developments of a controllable stereo camera head (mounted on a robot arm), generation of multi resolution pyramids for image representation, line extraction, linking and tracking. These operations are perform ed by newly developed special VME hardware for operation at 10 Hz.

POTENTIAL 
This Action will contribute to closing the gap between current vision approaches and techniques, and to the development of a true general-purpose vision system. In particular, it should greatly enlarge the potential applications of machine vision, openingup new opportunities for pre-competitive research and industrial applications.

Thus, compressive strain in III-V semiconductors offers the possibility of making p-channel MODFET's since the strain leads to a reduced hole effective mass. Unwanted non-radiative processes can be supressed in strained laser structures. 
The aims of this Action were to: 
-investigate and optimise the growth of strained InGaAs/InAlAs and InGaAs/InP structures for HEMT and MIS Like FET devices. 
-investigate the basic physics of strained structures: strain, relaxation mechanisms, band structures, transport properties. 
-process and test HEMT and MIS Like FET devices, and optimise all processing steps (growth, ohmic and Schottky contacts, channel thickness, doping) in order to evaluate the potential applications of strained structures as devices.
Strained indium gallium arsenic/indium aluminium arsenic and indium gallium arsenic/indium phosphorus structures have been grown and investigated. Strain assessment and strain relaxation mechanisms are presented for tensile and compressive layers. Experimental data of band offset measurements have been compared to theoretical calculations. Processing of high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and metal insulator semicondutor (MIS) like field effect transistor (FET) have been optimized. I-V good characteristics were obtained in HEMT and indium phosphorus metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) optimized devices. The maximum value of transconductance was measured in indium 0.6 gallium 0.4 arsenic channels thicker than 120 angstroms.

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements are presented for thin epitaxial layers of indium arsenide (InAs), of thickness between 2.5 and 36 angstroms, grown on indium phosphide by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The combination of efficient carrier capture and PL red-shift with increasing InAs thickness clearly indicates for formation of indium arsenide quantum wells on the indium phosphide surface. Data are also presented for indium arsenide/indium phosphide structures capped with strained layers of either gallium arsenide or indium aluminum arsenide and for indium arsenide/indium phosphide layers subjected to oxidation with time. Since radiative recombination within the indium arsenide layers can be distinguished from PL arising from both bulk and surface defects, this system allows the quality of both the indium arsenide/indium phosphide and indium arsenide/air interfaces to be monitored via their influence on the indium arsenide quantum well luminescence.

The excellent electronic and optical properties of indium based compound semiconductors enhanced by strain have made them increasingly important to the realization of long wavelength optical and high speed electronic devices. In particular, the indium arsenide/indium phosphide systems looks promising for the achievement of strained layer quantum well lasers. Single and multiple strained indium arsenide/indium phosphide quantum wells are grown by hydride vapour phase epitaxy which presents advantages such as the control of the surface stabilization or the independence of gaseous species. The ultrathin layers present a regularity of interfaces and a high degree of carrier confinement, revealed by photoluminescence investigations. This work confirms the possibility of the growth of indium phosphide/indium arsenide/indium phosphide quantum wells and multiquantum wells by the hydride vapour phase epitaxy (HVPE) method. The heterostructures are studied by photoluminescence in order to compare them to similar organometallic vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE) grown structures. The excitonic peak energy values obtained with HVPE grown and OMVPE grown quantum wells are approximately the same. Taking into account the approximations involved in the theoretical approach, the 1.28 eV peak energy can be attributed to 2 \/- 1 monolayers InAs thickness. The HVPE grown single quantum wells exhibit good quality interfaces as evidenced by 6 to 9 meV linewidths of exitonic emissions. Concerning the multiquantum wells grown by HVPE, the interdiffusion of V elements is probably responsible for the broadening of the photoluminescence spectra. Additional bands are present in multiquantum wells grown by HVPE as well as in the single quantum well of about 4 monolayers grown by OMVPE. These bands are attributed to fluctuations of the InAs layer thickness. The HVPE method appears to be comparable to OMVPE method as regards the quality of grown heterostructures. In addition, it is a cheaper and safer method, very promising for heterostructures achievement.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
-Strained and unstrained InGaAs/InAlAs structures were grown by MBE and strained and unstrained InGaAs/InP structures by HVPE. Double crystal X-ray diffraction (DCXRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and photoluminescence spectr oscopy (PL) enable the determination of the composition, structural quality confinement and interface abruptness of deposited quantum wells (QW). 
-Strain assessment has been performed by DCXRD and raman spectroscopy and deduced from the PL peak position and from its temperature dependence, which gives the heavy hole-light hole splitting in tensile samples. Relaxation mechanisms are investigated by HRTEM and RHEED oscillations, and alloy clustering in InGaAs layers by phototransmittance and HRTEM. 
-Band structures and band offsets are computed in the tight-binding approximation and investigated by DLTS admittance technique, photoluminescence excitation, photoconductivity, photoreflectance, high resolution infra-red absorption, photoluminescence an d raman spectroscopy under electric field. 
-Transport properties in device structures are measured by low temperature mobility, parallel transport and vertical transport by resonant tunelling. Schottky and ohmic contacts processing are systematically investigated using XPS, transmission line meas urement and I(V) characteristics. HEMTs are fabricated and optimised devices characterised by extrinsic conductance measurement. Two technologies, Si\ ion implantation and MBE growth of n\ doped InGaAs layers, are used for processing and testing InP MISFET and InP/InGaAs/InP MIS Like FET devices. A quasi-analytical self-consistent model for HEMTs and modelling of charge transfer in MIS-like FET have been developed. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Insulating In0.52Al0.48As layers of highest quality obtained at 530 C. InxGa1-xAs QW and MQW grown in the range 400 C-500 C and in the x range 0.53 - 0.65. 
-Homogeneous InAs QW with a PL line at 1.28 eV (FWHM = 6 meV), 1-2 mm thick, and 10 and 20 InAs QW separated by 200  thick InP layers grown by HVPE. Lattice-matched and strained InxGa1-xAs/InP QW 100  grown. The interface abruptness is not yet fully optimised compared to the InxGa1-xAs/InAlAs QW grown by MBE. 
-Strain assessment of InxGa1-xAs layers grown by MBE at 515 C performed as a function of thickness. In all samples, composition modulation along <100> directions with wavelength decreasing from 605 nm for thin layers to 240 nm for thick layers found atthe interface. Beyond the critical thickness, misfit dislocations not observed at the interface; relaxation of energy by means of defect nucleation more favourable than a further decrease of the modulation period. Same composition modulation observed in InxAl1-xAs samples. 3-D nucleation onset and strain relaxation determined as a function of composition and growth temperature. 
-Alloy disorder in InGaAs is related to spinodal decomposition. 
-Good fit obtained between experimental data and calculated results of band offsets. Theoretical investigations focused on the description of bulk and band structure of strained materials; calculation of band alignments in InGaAs/InAlAs system; possibili ty of breaking the transitivity rule, and even tuning band offsets by depositing thin intralayers at the interface; and a study of confinement and parallel conduction in ultrathin InAs/InP QW. 
-High Schottky barriers fabricated with n-InP and n-InAlAs and thoroughly probed by XPS as well as transport techniques. 
-HEMT structures growth and processing optimised. No deep level found in InAlAs. Mobility of 104cm2/sV measured in In0.65Ga0.35As channels of HEMTs. InxGa1-xAs channels with a thickness of at least 120  and an x value of 0.60 were found to give the besttransconductance which increases from 320 ms/mm at x=0.53 to 360 ms/mm at x=0.60. I-(V) measurements show good characteristics. 
-InP MISFETs have been processed using a 800  thick SiO2 layer as insulator and an Si1 ion implantation process carried out through an InGaAs mask (also used as encapsulant). The I-(V) characteristics are among the best static performances reported foran enhancement mode MISFET.

8210;3260;TOPP;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Transverse Optical Patterns;01/09/1989;31/08/1991;;"The TOPP Action aimed to solve the following problems: 
-information encoding into transverse field structures emitted by lasers 
-utilisation of lasers for the execution of complex logic functions, such as pattern recognition and image processing.
A theoretical and experimental study of pattern formation in lasers and other non-linear optical resonators was made. Non-linear optical systems of large Fresnel number were applied in complex logic functions such as pattern recognition. Lasers were examined (as typical example of non-linear resonators) for possible use in parallel optical processing, similar to optical neural networks but with substantially higher speeds. Lasers can emit radiation patterns containing phase singularities of order minus to plus infinity. These singularities tend to be arranged in a crystalline manner. For problems involving expansions in models of indices up to a sum of 4, stable laser emission patterns have been derived from a variational principle. These patterns can contain phase singularities of order up to 4. Radiation patterns exhibit multistability, which already permits the simpler kinds of pattern recognition and image processing. Theoretical predictions have been confirmed using helium-neon and sodium (Na2) (laser-pumped) lasers, showing optically induced switching between coexisting radiation patterns. Theoretical work shows the mathematical correspondence of lasers with compressible fluids(and of phase singularities with vortices). The existence of free optical vortices shows that lasers are capable of high numbers of coexisting states (images). One way of coding information into the transverse structure of laser fields is to use dislocated optical vortex crystals, or the pixellization of images by using arrangements of phase singularities of different charge.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The research started from noting that non-linear systems usually show coexistence of solutions or states between which switching is possible (eg for an optical system by optical means), so that decision-making and pattern recognition by lasers are conceivable. 
Work focused on the role of defects or optical singularities and their geometric arrangement in laser fields as a method for coding information into the laser fields themselves, and took into account the similarity between the temporal evolution and finalstates of certain cellular automata and lasers. 
Theoretical studies addressed the laser equations, including transverse effects. The optical pattern formation cases which can be treated by mode expansions were studied. The possible and stable optical patterns were found from a variational principle. The experiments used, among others, optically pumped lasers to test the predictions made. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Lasers can emit radiation patterns containing phase singularities of order minus to plus infinity. These singularities tend to be arranged in a crystal-like manner. 
-For problems involving expansions in modes of indices up to a sum of 4, stable laser emission patterns have been derived from a variational principle. These patterns can contain phase singularities of order up to 4. 
-Radiation patterns exhibit multistability, which already permits the simpler kinds of pattern recognition and image processing. Theoretical predictions have been confirmed using He-Ne and Na2 (laser-pumped) lasers, showing optically induced switching be tween coexisting radiation patterns. 
-Theoretical work shows the mathematical correspondence of lasers with compressible fluids (and of phase singularities with vortices). 
-The existence of free optical vortices shows that lasers are capable of high numbers of coexisting states (images). One way of coding information into the transverse structure of laser fields is to use dislocated optical vortex crystals, or the pixellis ation of images by using arrangements of phase singularities of different orders. 
-In addition to stationary transverse patterns, the laser is able to give rise to dynamical structures, for example rotating patterns or structures which display creation and annihilation of pairs of vortices (phase singularities) with opposite topologic al charge. 
-An optical associative memory might be realised by combining a multistable laser with a linear optical system composed of lenses, holograms and pinholes. The memory consists in a set of images stored in one of the holograms; the number of images is equa l to the number of coexisting stationary states of the laser. 
POTENTIAL 
Non-linear optical resonators (possibly semiconductors) could be used for parallel optical processing in the same way as the 'optical neural networks' but with substantially higher speeds. This would enable complex tasks like image processing and pattern recognition to be executed much faster than with current technology. 
Systems which perform gating and routing operations can be conceived. Rotating patterns could be utilised, for example, to realise optical tweezers or to perform scanning operations.";;;;;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt;DE;Università degli Studi di Genova;IT;

Activities include the development of a DWL 2.0 machine for very quick turnaround line (VQTL) ASIC fabrication, the development of a foundry independent design system (the uncommitted design system) and the thorough evaluation of the usability of project results for small and medium sized enterprises SME).

The first prototype of the DWL 2.0 machine was displayed at SEMICON Europe '91, and preproduction models were then constructed for beta site testing. The evaluation identified corrections needed for the equipment toperform at the target geometries and its feasibility was confirmed.

Studied, including all facets of the infrastructure needed to provide very quick turnaround ASICs, were completed with specifications for implementation. This work included optimum telecommunication methods, design frameworks, process technologies for multilayer interconnects, process equipment requirements including integration concepts and an application review for the requirements of fast turnaround ASICs in Europe.

A first tentative demonstrator design was achieved using tools which are being adapted to an open design environment. Contacts with silicon foundries have been established.
The DWL 2.0 machine, under development by one of the partners, exploits direct write laser-based lithography techniques to achieve multi-layer personalisation on a generic blank array, allowing the use of multivendor gate array and sea-of-gates wafers. Rapid image-recognition methods are used for laser beam guidance, which scans by means of acousto-optic deflectors and modulators. A multi-layer process will later be developed in the project, as well as automated wafer handling, process automation and process clustering and integration. 

The Uncommitted Design System will provide the user with a wide choice of design techniques and tools by the adoption of a design framework for CAD tool integration. It will provide foundry independence by means of uncommitted libraries, allowing for part of the design cycle of a circuit to be performed without an initial commitment to a particular vendor or chip. This flexibility will allow the automatic generation of multiple silicon implementations for the same design. A geographical network of non-homogeneous platforms will be tested out, that allow remote access to design tools and libraries.

8223;3216;CHARME;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Correct Hardware Design Methodology: Towards Formal Design and Verification for Provably Correct VLSI Hardware;01/07/1989;29/02/1992;;"Functional verification is the bottleneck of VLSI design systems. For economic and industrial reasons, VLSI circuit designs  must be completely validated before manufacturing begins. Current VLSI validation is done mainly through simulation with a limitedset of test stimuli. This does not guarantee correctness. 
Formal verification methods, on the other hand, are analytic, and have the potential to guarantee the correctness of implemented circuits. Most formal verification approaches, however, suffer from complexity. 
The aim of the CHARME Action was to investigate which verification approaches are appropriate for particular classes of hardware designs and specific levels of abstraction in the hardware design trajectory.
A suite of promising methods for formal very large scale integration (VLSI) hardware verification has been investigated, resulting in a methodology of 'design for verifiability' with the appropriate verification algorithms and methods for all levels of abstraction, ranging from the transistor switch up to the instruction level. This technology will enable VLSI designers to prove their designs correct before production begins.

Based on a suite of benchmark circuits, with representations at several levels of abstraction, different verification methods were investigated. The benchmark circuits consist of combinatorial logic, controllers, finite state machines, multipliers, arithmetic logic units (ALU), parameterized module generators, and microprocessors. The levels of abstraction considered were metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor, structural register transfer, behavioural register transfer, and microprogram, microinstruction and instruction.
To verify the correctness of the specification versus the implementations at these levels, a number of basic verification techniques were used: Boolean provers, proof of automata, and general purpose theorem provers. These support verification at the following levels: microprogramme architecture, structural register transfer (RT) versus behavioural RT, and RT versus switch level.

Different aspects in the area of the formal verification of very large scale integration (VLSI) hardware have been studied. Formal verification, given the appropriate methodologies, algorithms and formalisms, will find its place in actual computer aided design (CAD) systems for industrial hardware designs. Research results include a link-up of formal verification tools to the computer hardware description language VHDL as well as the demonstrated formal verification of actual VLSI chips of over 32 000 transistors from the layout up to high level algorithmic specifications. This is the largest full verification of a complete integrated circuit done thus far.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Based on a suite of benchmark circuits, with representations at several levels of abstraction, different verification methods were investigated. The benchmark circuits consist of combinatorial logic, controllers, finite state machines, multipliers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), parameterised module generators, and microprocessors. The levels of abstraction considered were MOS transistor, structural register transfer, behavioural register transfer, and microprogram, micro-instruction and instruction.To verify the correctness of the specifications versus the implementations at these levels, a number of basic verification techniques were used: Boolean provers, proof of automata, and general-purpose theorem-provers. These support verification at the following levels: microprogramme architecture, structural register transfer (RT) versus behavioural RT, and RT versus switch level. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The Action has concentrated on the behavioural correctness verification, as follows: 
-Transistor switch-level circuits extracted from the layout are used as the starting point. Symbolic analysis techniques that model different transistor strengths and node sizes have been developed and implemented, including appropriate modelling of thebi-directional characteristics of MOS transistors. 
-An efficient OBDD package, TAUTO, has been implemented and successfully compared with other top-level packages. TAUTO is used as a basic abstract data type in other verification tools of the Action. 
-An RT-versus-RT verification tool, LOVERT, has been developed. 
-Efficient algorithms for FSM specification versus implementation checking using implicit as well as symbolic enumeration methods have been developed and benchmarked. 
-The Boyer-Moore theorem-prover has been integrated in a CAD system for the formal verification of high-level synthesis libraries and parameterised hardware modules from layout up to specification (for the complete range of allowable parameters). 
-A translation has been realised from VHDL to the verification tools LOVERT, TACHE and Boyer-Moore. 
-A comparison has been made between Boyer-Moore and HOL for the verification of generic datapath-dominated hardware. 
-The OTTER resolution-based theorem provers have been investigated for hardware verification. 
-A micro instruction specification editor, micro-SPEED, has been implemented. 
-A first prototype of the CIRCAL system, based on the concept of process algebras, has been implemented. XCIRCAL, a user-friendly language, has been defined and implemented. 
-Aspects of design for verificability rules, as well as design for verificability methodologies, have been worked out. 
-The SFG-Tracing methodology for the specification versus implementation verification has been defined and applied to the correctness verification from high-level algorithm specifications down to layout-extracted transistor circuits. This has been succes sfully used in the full formal proof of a 32000 transistor modem chip. 
POTENTIAL

These themes are embodied in 3 focused lines of action:
application specific integrated circuits (ASICS);

integrated sensors.

This special action has stimulated a great deal ofactivity in its first 18 months of operation and there is already evidence of increased capacity for integrated circuit (IC) design in both the industrial and academic sectors.

During this initial period some 60 firms submitted their project proposals to the organising committee, Grupo Activador de la Microelectronica en Espana (GAME). Following success in the evaluation process, 42 projects have been launched. 2 of these projects are working in the smart power sector, 4 are working on sensors and the balance are undertaking ASIC demonstration activities.
These themes are embodied in three focused lines of action: 

- Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICS): the action will build up centres of expertise via technology transfers and execute a number of ASIC designs primarily with Spanish SMEs who will in the course of the Action gain their first experiences in the application of state-of-the-art ASIC technologies. 
- Smart Power: this technology offers the potential for conversion from electromechanical-based industry to a fully electronic one. The actions will build on the embryonic capabilities which already exist in Spain and devise demonstrations of new applications applicable to exploitation in the Spanish industrial context. 
- Integrated Sensors: a relatively new field, with great potential application in the emerging Spanish industries. In this Action emphasis is placed on aspects of monitoring and control of the environment and work to develop a range of new sensors and technologies is attracted participation from a wide range of industry.

Two testbeds are being developed, the first focusing on the path finding and manoeuvring capabilities of the robot vehicle, and the second highlighting the object recognition and flexible response capabilities required in a diagnostic data acquisition task.
A key issue within the project is the development and testing of an information framework called the Perception and Control Model. Based on this model, the decision system uses a combination of symbolic and numeric techniques, thus combining the strong points of both control engineering and artificial intelligence approaches. The combination of the two approaches will be demonstrated in two distinct testbeds. The first emphasises path-finding and coarse manoeuvring capabilities in a robot vehicle, the second highlights coarse and fine manoeuvres as well as flexible mission planning, as required in a diagnostic data acquisition task. 

The integration of symbolic and numeric models will enable these systems to meet the major requirements of the control system: 

- understanding a complex environment 
- manoeuvring in non-exceptional situations 
- supervising tasks, and decision making in unpredicted or degraded situations. 

The techniques and components developed by the project are foreseen to have applications in mobile robots used within CIM installations and in hostile environments, e.g. the storage of nuclear waste products or other poisonous, inflammable or explosive materials, and the dismantling of nuclear power-plants.

The UCOL workplan has addressed comprehensively optical component technologies as well as networking aspects of coherent multichannel concepts (eg topologies, access protocols, network management methods).
The project targets the enhanced performance and flexibility that can be built into a multichannel, ultrawideband network using coherent optical techniques. The system concept is based on multichannel optical transmission with heterodyne detection, where all optical channels are synchronized to an optical reference comb.
A key feature of the system concept is that the bandwidth and the optical frequency tuning facilities offered by coherent optics are conveniently exploited and used in an open systems interconnection (OSI) compatible context to achieve a network capable of connecting existing networks and of supporting new wideband services. The tuning characteristics of optical frequencies, in particular, enhance the flexibility of the network, and its ability to self reconfigure without physical changes facilitates its adaptation to future requirements. The advantages offered by the approach can be summarized as follows:
wide attainable bandwidth which may be extended;
use of a multichannel system with tuneable frequencies affords additional flexibility;
high receiver sensitivity;
optical amplifiers can be used.

Work has led to the production of the following practical integrated optical components and subsystems:
erbium doped fibre tunable narrow line laser (this provides the basic transmitter module in the system);
multiline source (based on a mode locked semiconductor external cavity laser, it generates a comb of optical spectral lines from which the channel carriers are synthesized);
active phase modulator and switch (based on a travelling wave semiconductor laser amplifier, it provides both phase modulation and switching);
balanced polarisation diversity differential phase shift keying (DPSK) (time division multiple access (TDMA)) receiver (this module is made up of 3 basic parts, a polarization diversity hybrid, a low nose preamplifier and a DPSK demodulator and signal regenerator);
tunable optical filter (a novel single mode fibre pigtailed Fab ry-Perot (FP) type filter was fabricated based on a reflection coated graded refractive index (GRIN) lens FP reasonator).
The well known advantages of frequency division multiplexing systems and the very efficient exploitation of the huge bandwidth offered by a single mode fibre are only accessible if the formidable technical problems (eg tuneable narrow-band lasers, carrier modulation/demodulation, polarisation diversity receiver) are solved in a cost effective way and the network management tasks can be handled. 

At the physical layer the UCOL system approach is based on coherent multichannel transmission over a passive star network where all signal carriers are locked to a distributed optical reference comb. This very original approach together with the proposed access protocols and network management offer : 

- high network capacity (multigigabit/second) required by the foreseeable future demand of integrated office and data communication equipment. 
- high flexibility in terms of network capability to efficiently exploit the available bandwidth and to adequately support any type and quality of service. 
- adoption of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) allowing for an easy interworking with public and local networks. 
- future upgrading capability in terms of higher overall network capacity for the introduction of new services or higher service quality (eg HDTV).

In addition, all material and energy balances involving combustion are handled rigorously. New equipment models (boilers, gas turbines and furnaces) are added in order to optimize their operating conditions with possibility of selection amongst multiple fuels.

Other developments increase the reliability of the  iterative algorithms used and help the user solve convergence problems. 

Developments in SYNEP 

In Europe, most of the energy integration problems concern existing plants. This is why specific tools are developed to solve retrofit problems. 

This implies : 

New tools for existing heat exchangers : position, size, etc. 

Help to the user to select amongst different alternatives in view of the constraints. 

Tools to study and improve the integration of several processes through the utility systems (this approach allows plant wide integration).

8757;1736;ROARS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Robust Analytical Speech Recognition System;28/12/1990;27/12/1993;;"The goal of the ROARS project is to increase the robustness of an existing analytical speech recognition system (ie one using statistical knowledge about syllables, phonemes and phonetic features), and to use it as part of a speech understanding system with connected words and dialogue capability for two languages: French and Spanish.
Two identical hardware prototypes were built for speech analysis, the statistical knowledge necessary for the feature based approach has been established for Spanish and improved for French and, finally, the corresponding speech recognition systems were implemented. In this way acceptable recognition rates in a multispeaker environment were successfully demonstrated for the French recognition system and for a 100 word vocabulary (work is still in progress for the Spanish system). 

Simultaneously, a progressive and slow adaptation for vowel recognition was investigated and the Lombard effect was studied both in French and Spanish. 

Concerning the improvement of voice input robustness by use of dialogue and understanding, a set of tools was developed (editors, compilers, etc) in the domain of 'finalized dialogue', that is to say task oriented and cooperative. The implementation of the 2 demonstrations is in progress.
The work started from an existing system implemented for the French language. This system has been shown to operate in real time, to be speaker-independent, and has had satisfactory results with continuously uttered connected words. 

The aim of the first phase of the project was to develop and implement the corresponding knowledge-bases for the Spanish language and to enhance for both languages the robustness of this system against: 

- Intra- and inter-speaker changes in articulation, by the improvement of statistical knowledge used in the system. 
- Various ambient noises, by analysing the degradations induced on each acoustic cue used in the phonemic recognition system and the changes in articulation (at the feature level) when the speaker is under different noise conditions and by studying and testing improvements aiming to minimise these degradations. 

All these tasks are run in parallel for both languages, French and Spanish. In order to study, implement and test improvements, two identical hardware prototypes were built (one for the French application and one for the Spanish). 

The aim of the second phase was the implementation of two demonstrations of speech understanding for air traffic control (one in French, one in Spanish) and will be the integration of voice input with other devices (such as keyboards, tracker-balls and screens).";;;;;Thomson Sintra SA;FR;"CRIN;UNIVERSITAD POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA;ENA TELECOMUNICACIONES";"FR;ES";

REBOOT tackles the following problem areas: 

- methods for identifying suitable reusable information (including reverse engineering approaches) 
- techniques and tools for creating components and their associated descriptions 
- repository for components 
- techniques and tools for storing, retrieving and displaying components 
- techniques and tools for aiding evaluation and validation of components and their modification 
- use of components, including development methods, configuration management and rapid prototyping 
- non-technical aspects (organisational, economic, legal, psychological, educational and managerial). 

A characteristic feature of the REBOOT project is its holistic approach. In order to develop successful methodologies, the project simultaneously addresses solutions in all the areas mentioned above. REBOOT starts from state-of-the-art knowledge, using the competence of the participating organisations. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined by concurrent work on applications and theoretical studies. Carefully selected case-studies provide necessary feedback to the tool and method development processes. 

REBOOT will provide: 

- a versioned prototype repository for reusable software components which can be instantiated for different application areas and different users 
- associated reuse tools to develop (partially reused) components 
- a definition of a set of component models 
- methods for reuse of the components from the repository. 

REBOOT supports the enhancement of future standards for reuse-driven object-oriented software development as well as for appropriate tool support.

The main objective of this initiative is to achieve a position where harmonised and standard network services can be offered to the whole Portuguese R&D community, especially to the benefit of the large groups engaged in ESPRIT projects. 
The first phase of the project deals with a basic communication infrastructure at 64 Kbit/s with a nation-wide coverage for the academic community and a set of open applications running on top of this infrastructure. The introduction of 2 Mbit/s access and ISDN connections are planned for the second phase. The third phase (which is not part of this project) will be an upgrade of the RCCN infrastructure (2 Mbit/s, ISDN). 
The RCCN project consists of four activities: 
Implementation of a national X.25 backbone 
Installation of a nation-wide X.25 backbone with access lines at 64 Kbit/s at universities and research centres in Portugal (Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Aveiro and Coimbra). The remaining universities will have access to the backbone via the public X.25 network. 
X.400 E-mail service 
This part of the project will develop an X.400 network over the X.25 backbone and the PPSDN. Connectivity to other countries will be made via IXI through COSINE 'Well-Known Entry-Points' (WEPs). 
Additional work is related to the installation and operation of gateways between X.400 and other existing mail networks (X.400/RFC 822)

8218;3096;SPEC;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Formal Methods and Tools for the Development of Distributed and Real-Time Systems;01/05/1989;31/03/1992;;"Research into the four basic approaches to concurrency (temporal logic, automata, process algebras and assertional methods) has produced specification formalisms and associated development and verification tools that have had successful applications, but none of the formalisms completely solves the concurrency problem and all have their deficiencies. For example, temporal logic performs slendidly when proving global eventuality properties, while performing badly for local precedence properties. For automata this is exactly the other way around. The overall objective of the SPEC Action was to alleviate these deficiencies and to provide frameworks for the specification and development of distributed real-time systems that are both practically adequate and theoretically sound. So why cannot these two techniques of temporal logic and algebra be combined? In general this extends to a combination of temporal logic and algebraic techniques. Especially worthwhile has been the extension of both to real-time. Special attention is given to the development of more efficient (both in time and in space) model checking and other machine assisted verification algorithms and tools. In this respect, besides giving attention to the topics mentioned above, the aim is to extend Xesar with time and make it faster, and to extend and investigate into the possibilities of the Statechart formalism. sm.
The task of developing concurrent, distributed and real time systems was addressed. Deficiencies of the 4 basic approaches to concurrency are perceived as largely complementary, and the combination of these formalizms seen as possibly very effective. Besides combining formalizms, research is proceeding into broadening the scope of existing formalizms towards real time probability and narrowing the gap between the specification and executable code of concurrent systems by extending the model checking paradigm with recent techniques such as on the fly searching space generation, partial order, and symbolic techniques.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
-Combining existing formalisms, the result of fusing complementary formalisms, are being considered. One suggestion is to combine transition-based formalisms, such as finite-state automata or process algebras, with a logic-based formalism such as tempora l logic. Transition-based formalisms are ideal for describing local sequencing requirements, whereas logic-based formalisms are well-suited for representing global requirements and timing constraints. This combination has already partially been investigated in the past; in future their crossbreeding is foreseen within the context of an extension towards real-time and probability. 
-Broadening the scope of existing formalisms. Investigations are proceeding into the ability to handle real-time constraints. Other extensions are planned, such as adapting existing formalisms to genuinely distributed models of computation or to models c ontaining probabilistic information. Especially worthwhile is the extension to timed automata, timed process algebras and timed logics. A similar extension towards including probability is undertaken. Finally, a merging of timed process algebra formalismswith Statecharts is undertaken. 
-Narrowing the gap between formal specification and executable code. Two complementary efforts are being pursued. The first follows the development paradigm, and contains recommendations for an environment providing partially automated  support for devel opment within the context of process algebra. The second effort will strive to obliterate traditional dividing lines between specification and implementation languages, especially focusing on executable subsets of Temporal Logics and the language for real-time embedded systems LUSTRE. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Executable subsets of temporal logic have been identified and implemented, and the foundations of executable temporal logic firmly established. Model checking of an important class of continous time stochastic systems has been reduced to a finite state verification problem, and process algebras and logics for time and probability have been developed, plus a theory of probabilistic refinement. The temporal logic methodology has been improved to such an extent that volume 1 of a book has appeared, with volu me 2 following shortly. Oxford's timed CSP methodology, consisting of a hierarchy of untimed and timed models for CSP, with timewise refinement mappings in between, a multitude of industrial applications, and associated algebraic and temporal logic based proof theories, has been firmly established, resulting in a book. A general, generic, mathematical model for asynchrony has been given. 
Hooman's compositional assertional proof methodology for real-time distributed systems has been grounded in a book, with applications involving synchronous communication, asynchrony, local clocks, prioritised scheduling of processes, and maximal parallelism. One style uses metric temporal logic; the other uses Hoare-triples. Methods for 'on the fly' automatic verification have been extended to model checking, the implementation of behavioural equivalence based on bisimulation semantics, and minimalisation . The latter has been implemented in LESAR, a verification tool for LUSTRE. A new approach to model checking based on partial-order semantics has been introduced and implemented, and improved even more for safety properties. Distributed model checking on a hypercube has been initiated, demonstrating that this is one of the problems benefitting most from parallelisation. 
The real issues in establishing correctness of implementations of reactive systems have finally been tackled, transcending mere process refinement (since interface actions may change) and action refinement (since the nature of communication may change). ATL-based proof theory has been developed, and the change of synchronous to asynchronous communication has been worked out. Finally, The mathematical foundations of STATECHARTS and ESTEREL have been established and compared. 
POTENTIAL 
Considerable advances have been made towards the mechanised or semi-mechanised verification of embedded real-time systems. The incorporation of real-time and probability into process algebra theory allows for its further exploitation in work-benches. The  fundamental assertional concurrent process refinement techniques have been clarified and extended to the point of application and generalised to real-time and probabilistic systems. Unification of sequential refinement and verification techniques is very near, while for concurrency, considerable progress towards the unification of refinement techniques has been made, with extension towards real-time.";;;;;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN;NL;"FORTH RESEARCH CENTER OF CRETE;IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;Université de Grenoble I (Université Joseph Fourier);University of Manchester;KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT NIJMEGEN;SWEDISH INST.

The glove like advanced interface for the control of manipulative and exploratory procedures in artificial realities (GLAD-IN-ART) project deals with the development of a human computer interface system conceived for the active control of manipulative procedures represented in computer generated images.
The interaction device will be an instrumented glove, worn by the human operator and capable of recording the hand geometrical configuration in the control space. Information about the user's hand configuration can be used for controlling a virtual hand represented in the computer and interacting with the depicted artificial environment. The morphology of such an interface device allows the operator to control the motions of the represented virtual objects in a more natural way without the displacement constraints of current interaction devices. Inside a 3-dimensional control space, the pose of the human operator's wrist is recognized by a purposely developed vision system. The set of video cameras, shooting from fixed locations the user's hand/arm configuration, acquires information which can also be processed in order to implement the concept of gesture interface; the human operator sends commands to the software application by performing appropriate hand/arm gestures.
A further characteristic of the GLAD-IN-ART project is the attempt to introduce components that transmit kinesthetic forces and internal grasping force feedback sensations onto the user's wrists and hands respectively. The introduction of such systems could improve the sensation of reality felt by the user during the manipulative interaction procedure.

At present the design phase of the different GLAD-IN-ART components has been performed. Different solutions for hand proprioceptive sensors have been identified together with possible mechanical solutions for hand force feedback. An integrated workstation comprising both human computer interface and vision system is under development.
The morphology of such an interface device allows the operator to control the motions of the represented virtual objects in a more natural way without the displacement constraints of current interaction devices such as joy-sticks or handballs. 

A basic characteristic of the GLAD-IN-ART system is the management of components devoted to replicate kinesthetic force and internal grasping force feedback on the user's wrists and hands espectively. This greately improves the sensation of reality felt by the user during manipulative procedures.

Industrial applications cover two areas: optical character recognition (OCR) of printed documents and industrial vision for quality control. The industrial vision work focuses on improving both SMD (surface mounted device) assembly techniques and video-based grading systems for fruit.
Progress has been made in the definition of the virtual machine concept allowing different hardware processing entities to participate together to provide the definition of a generic heterogeneous architecture based on neurocomputing operators as well as other processors. Future work concerning the analysis of parameters about communication will allow the determination of the interconnection medium between all these entities. The analysis of neural algorithms has been completed and a set of compute-bound operations identified which are shared by all neural nets. Very large scale integration (VLSI) design of a neural signal processor that executes these operations has started. The functional block architecture of the system has been fixed at chip and board level. The design of all the key components of the software and silicon compiler workpackages has been completed. The preparatory phase for the industrial vision and optical character reader workpackages has been completed. The most challenging problems have been pinpointed and the first neural net solutions proposed.

The objective of the neurocomputing project is the construction of a general purpose neural computing system for Europe. This comprehensive system will encompass:
general purpose neurocomputer hardware (GPNC), which efficiently supports a wide range of neural networks;
a sophisticated neural programming environment allowing the efficient use of systems comprising the GPNC, domain specific processors and application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), plus conventional parallel computers and workstations;
a silicon compiler for the rapid production of ASICs;
3 industrial applications, in the factory and office, that demonstrate the capabilities of the hardware, software environment and silicon compiler, and neural networks.

The industrial applications cover 2 areas, optical character recognition (OCR) and industrial vision. The main results of the workpackage will be a system able to read printed documents and integrate them into any word processing system. The results of the industrial vision workpackage are intended on the 1 hand to improve surface mounted device (SMD) assembly techniques for future products, and on the other hand to improve fruit video grading systems.

3865;MR4*0190;EUROHEP;;FP2-MHR 4C;;FP2;European study group on viral hepatitis;01/07/1989;30/11/1990;;"The specific aims of this European concerted action were the following: 
- to assess the natural course and outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection. 
- to construct prognostic indices of chronic hepatitis B aiming for rational application of therapeutical approaches, namely antiviral drugs and/or liver transplantation. 
- to study viral antigen expression in liver and serum and relate it to markers of the specific and general immune response in the liver and blood. 
- to perform meta-analysis on completed and ongoing clinical trials on antiviral treatment of chronic HBV infection. 
- to construct prognostic indices for treatment-induced events in chronic HBV-infection. 
- to determine the therapeutic gain in survival after liver transplantation for chronic viral hepatitis. 
- to assess the efficacy of hepatitis B immunoglobulin in the prevention of recurrence of viral hepatitis after liver transplantation.
Retrospective data on over 370 liver transplants have been obtained from the European Liver Transplant Registry and from members of the Eurohep programme. A preliminary analysis indicates that survival after liver transplantation is excellent provided that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection does not recur. The incidence of recurrence is reduced in patients with HBV acute or chronic liver failure who are preoperatively HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) negative and receive anti-HB immunoprophylaxis postoperatively. Preoperative antiviral therapy may also reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

A European network (Eurohep) has been created, linking expertise on viral hepatitis, and allowing collation of results from individual centres, more precise estimates on the natural history of chronic viral hepatitis and analysis of the effect of antiviral therapy and of the outcome of liver transplantation. Results demonstrated that hepatitis B virus (HBV) related liver cirrhosis is not an unrelenting progressive disease but intervention aimed at inducing viral elimination and biochemical remission can prolong life expectancy significantly.
The clinical relevance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a fatal complication of chronic hepatitis B was increased during prolonged follow up. Screening for HCC might become a prerequisite for further improving life expectancy in patients with HBV related compensated cirrhosis of the liver.
Monitoring of hepatitis virus infections and assessment of the effects of intervention therapy has been aided by introduction of European standard samples for nucleic acid measurement.
The efficacy of alpha interferon, which inhibits viral protein synthesis, has been confirmed, although the effect was less than expected. Severe, rare side effects such as fatal hepatic decompensation and suicide following neuropsychiatric disturbances have been observed in European hepatology units, treating patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. It is recommended that patients undergoing this therapy are closely monitored.
Liver transplantation has yielded steadily improved results over the last 5 years, recurrence of the original disease being a main cause of graft or patient loss. Anti hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis at the time of surgery is effective in reducing the incidence of graft reinfection to less than 30%, thereby limiting graft and patient loss.
Viral hepatitis, in particular chronic viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, is an important health problem in Europe. In the high-endemic countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal there are at least 2.5 million virus carriers; in the low-endemic countries of North-Western Europe chronic viral hepatitis predominantly affects haemophiliacs, homosexuals and drug addicts, but 30 percent of virus carriers do not belong to specific risk groups. 

Chronic viral hepatitis appears to run a variable natural course. Subjects from North and Central European countries usually become infected during adult life, often through sexual practice, have high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and core protein (HBeAg) in the serum, and after a variable number of years clear HBeAg and HBV from the serum with remission of the inflammation of the liver. In Southern Europe, intrafamilial spread is common giving rise to infection early in life. Clearance of HBeAg occurs frequently, but HBV-replication with active liver disease can persist in antiHBe-positive patients. The existence of an emerging variant strain of the virus has been demonstrated. Moreover, hepatitis D virus (HDV) superinfection is particularly common in Southern Europe both in relation to intrafamiliar spread as well as to drug addiction. Conceivably, the ongoing pandemic of human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is spreading predominantly among homosexuals in North-Europe and among drug addicts in Southern countries, might modify the epidemiological, clinical and virologic patterns of the disease. The pathobiology of chronic viraemia is only partly understood and further study of immunology, environmental factors (lifestyle, virus-virus interaction) and molecular biology could elucidate why a small proportion of infected persons develop chronic viral hepatitis. 

All types of chronic viral hepatitis are now amenable to treatment by antiviral agents or liver transplantation. Alpha-interferon is being tested widely and will be licensed in Europe. This treatment is costly and only effective in a minority of patients. Similarly, the very costly therapy of liver transplantation is increasingly applied to patients with liver failure due to chronic viral hepatitis, although the effectiveness of this treatment modality appears uncertain. The evaluation of the modification of the natural history by such treatments is impossible by the incomplete knowledge of the prognosis without treatment. Furthermore, indications for intervention should be based on both prognosis and the expected benefits of the treatment. Results of antiviral drugs and liver transplantation vary widely from centre to centre, probably related to different characteristics of the patients and variable modes of treatment. In order to restrict treatment to subgroups of patients with chronic viral hepatitis who are most likely to benefit from it, cooperative research in both assessing prognosis as well as benefits and risks of treatments is mandatory. 

In addition to the studies on epidemiology, antiviral therapy and liver transplantation, the Eurohep programme includes a section on pathobiology aiming to diffuse standardized laboratory methodology for measurement of virus or virus antigens, and to facilitate basis research on blood or tissue samples from patients in the clinical research programmes.";;;;CON;University Hospital Dijkzigt;NL;;;

The intention was to capture the meaning of a program as a mathematically defined entity and to be able to reason about its behaviour. This language and methodology will fully support the object-oriented, transformational, and modular design of information systems. The objective was to achieve provably correct systems and higher levels of reusability. To this end, the Action addressed topics such as full integration of static and dynamic integrity checking, formal methods backed by a sound mathematical theory, and several design-in-the-large issues. .
The theoretical and methodological foundations of the formal, object oriented design of information systems were examined. An information system is viewed as a collection of interacting objects, each with its own data and interface to other objects. The concept of an object was theoretically analysed in order to achieve a mathematically sound formalization of the envisaged paradigm of information systems, which should fully support the required levels of reusability and the verifiability of their correctness.

In semantics several categorial models of objects were investigated, from the early strict interleaving models to full concurrency. A general framework formalizing objects as observed processes was developed where techniques for object composition and reification can be analysed independently of any specific model of evolution. Finally, exploration of graph theoretic semantics began for process reification.

With respect to languages both textual and visual (diagrammatic) features have been explored for supporting object specification and reification. The textual language has been directed mainly to composite objects, and to database specification and conceptual modelling. The visual one has concentrated on integrating support to reification and in the large design techniques.

Work on calculi involved theories in temporal and deontic action logics which have been explored as a semantic domain for object specification and for formalizing conceptual modelling techniques. Object interfacing and clientship were formalized in this setting. Functional relationships with model based domains were also established. Finally default logics were examined as a means of supporting incremental specification and inheritance with exceptions (overriding).

In addition, work on the comparison between the dyadic (binary) and the object oriented approaches was extended to other approaches and led to the extension of NIAM with modularisation mechanisms.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Combining the object-oriented paradigm with experiences in formal methods from software engineering, the IS-CORE Action integrated views and results from several sources. Among these are object-oriented programming, object-oriented databases, algebraic data-type theory, logical approaches to system specification and design, and algebraic theory of processes. 
The basic idea is to design an information system as a collection of interacting objects (some passive, some active), implemented in successive layers by means of other objects. This perspective closely follows the principle of 'data abstraction', by structuring properties and operations (methods, events or transactions) locally around each object in order to achieve high levels of reusability. Hence languages, verification techniques and methodological principles are necessary for specifying objects, their interactions and aggregations. 
Formal specification techniques have been adopted in the Action in order to make precise proofs of correctness and consistency possible. Clearly, an effective mathematical theory of objects (as processes endowed with attributes and initiatives) is necessary in order to establish an appropriate semantic domain for the envisaged languages and calculi. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Work has been carried out along the following lines: 
-Semantics. Several categorial models of objects were investigated, shifting progressively from the early strict interleaving models to full concurrency, and exploring universal constructions as a means of formalising techniques for process composition i  n the presence of interaction, as well as initiative and transactional requirements. A most general framework formalising objects as observed processes was developed where techniques for object composition and reification can be analysed independently of any specific model of evolution. Finally, graph-theoretic semantics started to be explored for process reification. 
-Languages. Both textual and visual (diagrammatic) language features have been explored for supporting object specification and reification. The textual language has been directed mainly to composite objects, and to database specification and conceptualmodelling. The visual one has concentrated on integrating support to reification and in-the-large design techniques. Both languages have been provided with model-theoretic semantics. Test cases have also been developed. 
-Calculi. Theories in temporal and deontic-action logics have been explored as a semantic domain for object specification and for formalising conceptual modelling techniques. Object interfacing and clientship were formalised in this setting, object inter connection being captured via interpretations between theories (theory morphisms), leading to design structures that modularise specification. Functional relationships with model-based domains were also established. Finally, default logics have started tobe explored as a way of supporting incremental specification and inheritance with exceptions (overriding). 
In addition, work on the comparison between the dyadic (binary) and the object-oriented approaches was extended to other approaches and led to the extension of NIAM with modularisation mechanisms. 
POTENTIAL 
The claimed advantages of the object-oriented computation paradigm will only become effective and of practical importance after a much better understanding has been achieved of the underlying theoretical concepts.

The type of service being considered includes online information services in the European environment. The target user group addressed is the business community. 
Telematic object oriented tools for services interfaces (TOOTSI) addresses the information market by providing customised common interfaces to relevant sets of remote services and by providing personalised user interfaces. The project will generate solutions adapted to specific problems and needs in an environment where diversity and complexity increasingly separate the information seeker from the information provider.
These tools are meant to support the designer in efficiently designing and implementing, at the end-user level, interfaces with the following features: 

- the same interface style across several services (and also across national boundaries) 
- the same data model to access several services (and also across national boundaries) 
- a global directory, allowing users to browse though the description of several services 
- integration with local application packages (spread sheets, word processors, databases, etc) 
- use of graphics features 
- use of advanced user interface methods 
- advanced services management (accounting, security, etc). 

In addition, special integration techniques will need to be used, as the common framework will be set up without requiring any modifications to the native languages and interfaces of the remote services, due to their extreme heterogeneity and the high number of different service providers.";;;;;Sarin Telematica SpA;IT;"Applied Research Group SpA;Centro di Cultura Scientifica Alessandro Volta;TELESYSTEMES;Olivetti Systems & Networks Srl;DESARROLLO DE SOFTWARE;INFOTAP;SOPHIATEC;UNIVERSITE DE NICE - LISAN;Algotech;Politecnico di Milano;Systems and Management SpA";"IT;FR;ES;LU";

The understanding of the behaviour of natural elements in clay formations is an unavoidable step towards the understanding of the fate of such radionuclides. Further laboratory studies are also needed to help forecast, by analogy the behaviour of radioelement released from deep radioactive repositories.

The ARCHIMEDE project aims at three major goals

1. understanding the mechanisms of acquisition and regulation of formation water chemistry in clay environment, as a result of water rock interactions;
2. testing and validating the physico-chemical parameters that describe the clay formation and its properties and that feed geochemical models;
3. applying these results to model a real clay environment : Boom Clay formation (Belgium).

Rock sample characterization is generally realized in the laboratory after sampling. Sampling techniques usually applied can sometimes significantly disturb the original geochemical and microbial state of the sediment. In this study special attention is paid to prevent such a drawback: the Boom clay formation (solid, fluid and gaseous phases) is sampled from the Underground Research Laboratory facility in Mol (Belgium) under anaerobic and aseptic conditions, and experimental works are designed in order to measure non conservative (pH, Eh) or potentially versatile parameters (interstitial fluids, trapped gases, cation exchange capacity) directly in the formation. Microbiological techniques will be developed for natural sample bacteriological characterization, in conjunction with conventional bacteriological investigations.
Seven drill works in the HADES Underground Research Facility (URF) at Mol were completed in 1992, apart from one which encountered technical problems. Solid and fluid sampling: a 20 m long horizontal core was drilled in the URF for solid and fluid sample collection. The work was performed under sterile and anaerobic conditions.

Fluid sampling: 2 15 m long horizontal piezometres were drilled on both sides of the previous work in order to collect large amounts of interstitial fluid. As previously they were completed under sterile and anaerobic conditions. One of them is equipped to house and optical fibre dedicated to in situ pH determination.

Experimental work: In situ deep freezing and coring (2 cores 2 m long), active geochemistry piezometre setting, and pH/Eh probe setting for in situ measurement have been completed.
Work programme:

The four main topics of the project are as follows

1. fluid and solid sampling, in situ measurements.
2. fluid and solid characterization.
3. microbial investigations.
4. fluid-rock equilibria modelling will integrate the results obtained after the characterization step.";2550000;1275000;;;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);FR;"Guigues Recherche Appliquee en Microbiologie SA;Centre d'Etudes de l'Energie Nucleaire-Studiecentrum voor Kernenergie CEN/ SCK;Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM);Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA)";"FR;BE";

The fluids/structure interaction forces must clearly be defined prior to the product development of a new generation High Speed Boilerfeed pump.  Furthermore, these unknown interaction forces are today the leading cause of unscheduled feed pump outages in power plants worldwide.  It is now recognized that centrifugal pump rotor dynamic behaviour is influenced tremendously by fluid/structure interaction forces generated at annular seals and impellers.  These forces can be divided into two groups : a) motion dependent forces, b) pure hydraulic excitation forces. 
Presently 2 experimental test rigs are operational radially and axially suspended in active magnetic bearings. Both test rigs allow identification of motion dependent fluid/structure forces and moments related to 5 degrees or freedom. Excitation forces also can be measured.

A new direct identification technique is developed and built into a data acquisition system for both test rigs. Theoretical fluid flow models are developed for long grooved and smooth annular seals and for the impeller shroud based on bulk flow models. Currently, finite difference fluid flow models are developed for the impeller shroud leakage path.

Research was carried out concerning fluid structure interaction forces generated in boilerfeed pump components. 

It was found that the frequency response functions (FRF) of a multistage pump rotor are completely changed just by water filling and the presence of shaft mechanical seals. Mechanical seal chambers, and wetted parts of the shaft as well as chambers with one dead end develop considerable MDI coefficients which change the dry FRFs of the rotor completely. 
Long annular clearance seals with large pressure differences develop important direct moment coefficients and also radial DOF to moment and angular DOF to force coefficients. Large L/D annular seals with small pressure difference develop a negative direct stiffness which is very destabilizing. Also, the finite difference, Kepsilon 2-dimensional fluid flow model can be used for shrouds as well as geometrically complex shaped wearrings. 

The MDI forces of shroud leakage flows were under estimated. It appeared in using real boiler feed pump impellers with actual annular seals show that most of MDI coefficients are generated in the leakage path of shroud and seal. It also appears that the leakage flow velocity and pressure field of the shroud as well as the MDI forces are determined by the impeller seal configuration. 

KMDI coefficients have also been identified. So far the investigations revealed for the radial and angular DOF of impellers that the most important coefficients for the radial rotor FRFs are the radial DOF force coefficients. The other coefficients are much less important for the linear response of the rotor. 

Axial KMDI coefficients were also generated for impellers and seals. Although no major coupling between the radial and axial DOF were discovered the direct axial coefficients are very high for both mechanical seals and impellers. Axial dynamic rotor studies of pumps can be carried out indecently from the radial bending dynamic analyses.
The fluid/structure interaction forces of annular clearance seals and impellers are the dominating factors in the dynamic (vibration) characteristics developed by large multistage boilerfeed pumps (BFP).  The fluids/structure interaction forces must clearly be defined prior to the product development of a new generation High Speed Boilerfeed pump.

Dot printing systems could have widespread use in workstations, word processors, high and low end typewriters and printers.
Electrothermal ribbon (ETR) is a dot type printing system without impact (and therefore silent), able to print in both alphanumeric and graphic mode at high resolution, and with excellent quality on every kind of paper.
It is thermal printing technology using solid ink deposited on a ribbon, softened by heat and then transferred to the paper. It can be considered as a development of conventional thermal systems.
Some new ideas concern the development of a completely different system for the deposition of the metallic layer, used as a return current path in the ribbon. The use of a base layer with a completely different structure is also investigated.
A different printhead is being developed to take into account the requirements for higher printing speed, such as resistance to wear and thermal dissipation. The last step will be the development of a prototype using a ribbon without the presently used metallic layer. In this case, the printhead may also have to be completely redesigned.

Although the technical results were achieved, the project was terminated prematurely due to the emergence on the marketplace of black and white and colour printers based on cheaper technologies (mainly laser and ink bubble jet).

The ROCKI project, which stands for Raster to Object Conversion aided by Knowledge based Image processing, has resulted in the development of a generic set of tools for interpreting complex information displayed in printed form. Using the ROCKI software package, information can be extracted from individual documents or maps and stored in computer files for subsequent processing, including data enhancement.

In designing the software package, a modular concept, in which the interpretation proces is plit into a number of dicrete phases has been selected. After a primitive interpretation stage, in which elementary features such as characters, continuous and dotted lines, and circles are identified, more structure is introduced in the object interpretation stage, when emphasis is placed on the recognition of, for instance, words and paragraphs in the case of office documents, and houses or factories in the case of maps. In the third interpretation phase, basic features are grouped into more complex objects along with the associated semantics. By organizing the various identification procedures in this way and using knowledge about the structure of documents and maps to guide the interpretation process, a highly versatile software package which should have a wide field of application has been developed.
The main workpackages deal with the evaluation and further development of algorithms for image processing and analysis guided by knowledge of the document architecture, and the definition of a common information and interpretation model leading to the specification of a common architecture for document interpretation.

The workstation is a teaching device aimed at intermediate ability foreign language learners. Audio and visual aids will be used to help students improve their general intelligibility within a basic teaching paradigm called DELTA (Demonstrate, Evaluate Listening, Teach and Assess). Prosodic analysis will apply to the features of intonation, stress and rhythm. A phonological approach is used for intonation which provides a structured system of contrasting units that correlate with discrete linguistic functions. A more limited approach to the prosodic phonology of stress and rhythm will be taught in the SPELL system (interactive system for spoken European language training) by manipulating the relatively simple acoustic features of vowel quality and segmental duration. The micro feature analysis will focus on the segmental class of vowels. A distinctive feature approach is used to characterize nonnative vowel pronunciation. Acoustic properties are sought which will be speaker independent.

The aim of the project is to analyse the speech characteristics of nonnative speakers and to develop tools to help them improve their spoken language skills. Topics of work have included phonetic analysis, phonetic distance metrics, multilingual systems, linguistics and computer aided instruction. The languages involved are English, French and Italian; they will be analysed in order to extract their phonetic characteristics.
This project is a feasibility study resulting in a demonstrator system able to process the voice of nonnative speakers in order to identify and correct pronunciation errors. The system guides the user through a set of examples which gradually improve pronunciation.

The means selected is a database containing usability design targets'(UDTs) whereby the IBC equipment developer is asked to specify the intended usage scenario and thereby access the appropriate database records to assemble the relevant 'usability' advice.  

Key Issues  
. To develop a definition and form of usability design targets.  
. To classify the needs of the database user (the IBC equipment developer) as well as the instances of use of the equipment by an IBC user.  
. To produce a methodology for manufacturing UDTs.  
. To develop the necessary computer techniques (database and user interface) and testing these various methods and techniques within specific application pilots in the RACE programme.  

Achievements  
. An improved concept of UDT.  
. Validated methodology for the production of UDT.  
. An interface and pre-production version of the database.  
. Over 100 experimental UDTs which were tested for content, structure and form.

Different optical processing architectures were compared so as to fully exploit the technology developed in earlier projects in new applications. This led to a recommendation for a practical architecture suitable for application to industrial problems in the very near future. 
A multichannel photorefractive optical joint transform correlator capable of performing sorting tasks for robotic applications has been designed, implemented and tested. The use of mini yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) lasers and crystal spatial light modulators, in conjunction with updatable holographic bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) crystals has resulted in a compact correlator (600 by 300 by 300 mm) with real time capabilities (100 ms recognition speed). Flexibility is a built in feature and correlation is demonstrated for various applications. Electronic and optical preand postprocessing for improving the demonstrator performances are also proposed.

The feasibility of optical processors for object recognition in laboratory environments was successfully demonstrated in previous projects. The goal of this project was to integrate the latest device and material developments with these new architectures in practical processors for use in industrial inspection, quality control, associative classification and signal processing. The first phase was a definition phase, where different architectures in optical processing were considered so as to fully exploit the technology developed in earlier projects in new applications.
A comparison of the possible approaches was completed with a recommendation of a practical suitable for application to industrial problems in the very near future. In the second phase of the project, a demonstrator integrating this architecture in a practical industrial application was developed and demonstrated.
A demonstrator integrating this architecture in a practical industrial application was completed by the end of 1991. 

Components of the system will be reused in further designs by Thomson-CSF.

The PYRAMID approach is based on specific technology transfer methods to accelerate the technology diffusion process. 

Specific activities will include: 

- analysing the underlining technology diffusion processes in the market for software metrics and the present lag in metrics use in Europe behind the USA and Japan, including the key reasons (technical and non-technical) 
- consolidating and exploiting other ESPRIT metrics projects work (eg COSMOS (2686), MERMAID (2046), MUSE (1257), REQUEST (300), SCOPE (2151) and SPEM (1527)) and successful leading-edge and best-practice applications experience in industry and government 
- promoting in all Community countries the appropriate use of metrics and applying the most effective technology transfer mechanisms, avoiding duplication with other efforts.

In order to diminish casualties of hereditary cancer of the colon the concerted action Genetic Studies in Cancer Families with primary regard to familial adenomatous polyposis of the colon (EUROFAP) was set up. Initially, the study comprised identification and registration of patients and families with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). A second stage of registration involved hereditary nonpolyposis cancer of the colon (HNPCC). 

In March 1991 a course, The Establishment of a Polyposis Register, was held in Copenhagen. Then a meeting of International Collaborative Group HNPCC and EUROFAP was held (September 1991) to coordinate international activities including European efforts concerning HNPCC. In April 1991 a Laboratory and Linkage and Analysis Course was given in Leiden. 

Special computer programmes have been made available. These comprise a Clinical FAP registration programme a FAP megabase 2.0 programme for graphic pedigree handling and linkage calculation as well as risk evaluation and a HNPCC megabase programme adjusted, for more elaborate handling of the clinical registration data, graphic pedigree handling, for linkage and risk evaluations. 

In 1991 the FAP (APC) gene was identified through an international effort including EUROFAP. Continued development of efficient flanking markers, extragenic as well as intragenic, is necessary. 

A workshop on Genetic environment interaction in various FAP mutants (January 1992) considered plans for testing the possible dietary effect of crystalline starch on the development of polyps in carriers of the FAP gene. 

In May 1992 a Workshop Genetics of HNPCC was held with the primary purpose of making up an inventory of families with HNPCC to be used in a search for the HNPCC gene(s). Later a special HNPCC linkage committee was established. 

Efforts towards complete registration of individuals and families with FAP and HNPCC in the European countries have been pursued which will serve the genetic studies as well as the preventive and therapeutic activities. General reports on FAP/HNPCC have been prepared by special committees involving social issues, surveillance and management, and HNPCC in Europe.
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis of the Colon, or FAP, is an inheritable autosomal dominant pre cancerous condition with adenomas which leads in all untreated cases to development of cancer of the colon and eventually death. Hereditary Non-Polyposis Cancer of the Colon or HNPCC is an autosomal dominant cancer like FAP, but without any clinical pre-cancerous marker like the adenomas in FAP. Quantitatively, untreated cases of FAP would give about 1% of casualties from cancer of the colon; while the proportion of hereditary cases, when HNPCC cases are included, would be 5-10%. The present Concerted Action has taken FAP as a model for study and prevention in a first phase, while aiming eventually at HNPCC as well.

The common goal of all participating institutes is to contribute towards reducing casualties from cancer of the colon, in the first place with regard to FAP, and later extended to include HNPCC.

The position of the EUROFAP Concerted Action in the European Strategy is essentially to serve as a model for reducing casualties in hereditary kinds of cancer.";;;;CON;University Institute of Human Genetics;DK;;;

The knowledge base may contain predictive models for various aspects of crop management such as crop growth, disease susceptibility, nutrient and irrigation requirements. Agrometerological data is an essential input to the knowledge base and there is a need to develop a standardized format for this that will allow interfacing with predictive models and farm management systems. Work is being done to select and integrate some well tested predictive models with agrometerological data networks to create interactive decision support systems for farm management.

Software is being developed for 3 crops, namely, wine graphs, apples and wheat that can be used to improve the accuracy of farmers' weather related decisions, in particular, the timing and frequency of chemical applications and irrigation. Formats of meterological data used in agrometerological networks have been collected and compared. A programme is being developed for transferring data from weather stations to microcomputers via telephone lines for storing the data in a structural query language (SQL) database. Predictive models have been surveyed for wine graphes, apples, wheat and irrigation and some of these are being adapted for implementation. These include models for evapotranspiration, water balance and plant development and models covering a range of vine diseases. In particular, the model of risk analysis for plasmopara viticola is being developed for the north of Italy.
At present, wide scale implementation of P.M.D.A. is hindered by various causes.  For example insufficient established and adapted models, insufficient integration of previsional models with agrometeorological data networks and insufficient standardization of interfaces to agro meteo networks.  This situation calls for a well thought out intervention to coordinate model testing and implementation.  

The tasks of project SYBIL are :  

a) attain integration of well tested Previsional Models for wheat, wine, apple and models for irrigation into regional Agro-meteorological data networks within interactive Decision support systems for individual farm adapted crop management advice to fill the gap between models and networks;  

b) establish a methodology for ensuring modularity, portability and extensibility to additional regions of P.M.D.A. by introducing uniform software engineering, including uniform choices for data structures, computer platform and user interface;

The project aims to apply neural networks to forecasting and diagnosis problems.
At the heart of the project is the development of a unified description language (ie a unified framework). Its goal is to classify and describe different well studied paradigms, as well as novel ones, within the domain considered. Such a language is crucial in order to get a consistent framework for applications and a deeper understanding of neural networks. A number of existing applications will be thoroughly analyzed to provide input for the development of the framework. With the help of the unified language, topological and architectural heuristics will be formulated.

3 existing and 1 novel application are being considered and are progressing. The existing applications are phoneme recognition, integration of heart scan data, and the forecasting of water demand and consumption.
1 novel application is examined in particular: the problem of disturbance analysis in electrical networks. This is also intended to help in refining the prototypes of the other applications.
3 major architectural aspects of neural networks are currently investigated with promising results:
architectures that can handle temporal sequences of input patterns;
the preprogramming of knowledge into networks;
architectures that can deal with a changing environment.
The unified description language for describing neural network paradigms has been developed and successfully used within the project for the development of customised applications. The methodology has also been used for benchmarking the major neural network paradigms (i.e. classification with regard to specific applications). 

Promising and innovative results have been obtained in the following areas of research: (1) architectures that can handle temporal sequences of input patterns; (2) the pre-programming of knowledge into networks; (3) architectures that can deal with changing environments. 

Prototype systems have been developed for the following applications: (a) forecasting of water demand and consumption; (b) heart-scan data interpretation, (c) electrical network fault detection, (d) rainfall prediction; (e) sales prediction; and (f) traffic prediction.

Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails.
The European study on antioxidants myocardial infarction and cancer of the breast (EURAMIC) multicentre case control study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that male myocardial infarction (MI) cases and female breast cancer (BC) cases have a lower antioxidant status than control subjects without these diseases. Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails. Data collection ended 31 October 1992 for the MI study, and 31 December 1992 for the BC study. For the MI study biomarker data has been collected for 712 cases and 733 controls. For the BC study the number of cases and controls is 318 and 466 respectively. The distribution of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in the different centres has been analysed for 90% of the data. Classical risk factors like smoking, hypertension and diabetes are significantly more prevalent in the cases. Laboratory analysis of antioxidants has not yet been completed. Mean alpha tocopherol and beta carotene levels, as well as a risk estimate for low pressure levels have been produced for 40% of the data. Remarkable differences exist between centres, southern countries showing a relatively low beta carotene level, but also the variation within centres is large. Small numbers for some centres in the analysis do not permit any conclusions to be drawn so far. Estimates of the relative risk of MI at low antioxidant levels show an increased risk for low adipose tissue beta carotene, but none for alpha tocopherol. These findings need further exploration, including possible interactions. Results for selenium status for about 1200 subjects have been obtained recently and data analysis is in progress.
Many studies have implicated free radical oxidative reactions in age-related disorders, such as cardiovascular and malignant disease. Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidative reactions by scavenging reactive oxygen-derived radicals and/or by interfering with the chain-reaction of peroxidation. Both vitamins (e.g., alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid) and enzyme-linked trace-elements (e.g., selenium, copper, zinc) are essential components of the antioxidant defense of the body.
It is hypothesized that the risk of developing age-related diseases is influenced by the balance between oxidant stress and antioxidant defense.
The fat-soluble antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene and the trace element selenium were investigated in the EURAMIC Study. These three substances may all be derived from usual dietary sources. Although the protective role of these substances has been studied separately in epidemiologic studies, their joint action over a wide range of dietary intake and antioxidant status is not well elaborated. As antioxidant requirements are related to fatty acid intake, especially of polyunsaturates, fatty acid composition is of additional interest.

Acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer have been selected as the diseases of interest. The sudden clinical occurrence of a first myocardial infarction and the diagnosis of breast cancer in an early stage, avoid secondary changes in life-style and exposure status.
Acute myocardial infarction is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in men and postmenopausal women. In addition to increased disease risk from smoking, elevated serum cholesterol and blood-pressure, antioxidants may beneficially affect cardiovascular disease risk by reducing oxygen-induced damage to lipids, lipoproteins and endothelial tissue. Breast cancer is the most important cancer among European women. In addition to reproductive and hormonal factors, which do not lend themselves to preventive measures, dietary factors including the natural antioxidants may be involved. Antioxidants may prevent oxygen-related DNA-damage in ductal epithelium of the mammary gland.

For acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer, the following hypotheses were tested in the EURAMIC Study:
1 The concentration of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails is lowered in cases as compared to healthy population controls.
2 The shape of the antioxidant-disease relationship is non-linear, i.e. the increased risk may be most pronounced at low antioxidant concentration.
3 The antioxidants affect disease-risk synergistically, in particular for alpha-tocopherol and selenium. Furthermore, the alleged protective effect of beta-carotene may be particularly important at low alpha-tocopherol/selenium status or in smokers experiencing high oxidant stress.";;;;CON;TNO Food and Nutrition Institute;NL;;;

Today, the three companies Merck (D), BDH (UK) and Hoffman La Roche (CH) almost control the entire world market for these materials. Nevertheless, the European position on LC devices, components and sub-assemblies for panels is less favourable, and Japanese suppliers dominate the global market, with large sales in Europe. 

There are, however, a number of European companies with the technical capabilities to produce LCDs and to compete worldwide, provided that production investments are made on an appropriate scale for a well-defined technology. 

Investigation of the different technological requirements for the production of a large complex flat-panel display has been completed. 

The approach, which is now widely recognised as the most promising, is to deposit a matrix of switching transistors on an inner wall of the LCD (AMLCD). Three of the partners have demonstrated their technical know-how in the field of active matrix panels by the realisation, at the laboratory level, of displays with viewing areas of approximately 10 x 10 cm{2} and resolution up to 256 x 256 pixels (see project 833). 

Although applications for such displays are expected in small portable equipment and video projectors, it seems necessary to develop larger (A4) high-resolution panels to meet the key requirements of office terminals. The main goal of the project is therefore to validate technologies for the production of active matrix LCDs up to A4 in size.
There are a number of European companies with the technical capabilities to produce liquid crystal displays (LCD) and to compete worldwide, provided that production investments are made on an appropriate scale for a well defined technology. Such a display, compact and operating at low voltage, must be able to show colour and grey scale with high resolution and should be less bulky than current cathode ray tube (CRT) devices in orderto fulfil office systems requirements in the near future.
The main goal of the project is therefore to validate technologies for the production of active matrix LCD up to A4 in size. The work involves the preparation of direct view flat panel displays using amorphous silicon wilth external integrated circuit (IC) drivers in the short term, or using polycrystalline silicon with integrated drivers as an alternative in the longer term. During the first 3 years of the project the realization of an A4 amorphous silicon matrix will be carried out, and, in parallel, a polycrystalline silicon process with integrated drivers and A4 glass compatibility, including A4 specific equipment, will be developed (6 inch diagonal demonstrator).
A complete new facility dedicated to the realization of 14 inch x 14 inch substrate displays has been built near Grenoble, and is already experiencing problems arising form amorphous silicon display production in a pilot line. A5 8-colour displays have been demonstrated as a first step towards the final goal. The processing of the panels is on course. The consortium recently demonstrated a 2.8 inch diagonal active matrix LCD display with fully integrated polysilicon row and column drivers. The device contains a 200 x 200 pixel array, and can be driven through a 28-pin connector.

The second step is component development, leading to the realisation and demonstration of a prototype.
Modular control architecture regarding hardware and software with structured links to the computer integrated manufacture (CIM) and servo level is aimed to cover a wider range of applications for robotics. Redundant degrees of freedom and a flexible link structure are important features for the proposed type of robotics. Geometric and dynamic parameter identification is required as well as online configuration planning for local collision avoidance. A standard for the link between system and servo level for hydraulic drives in a distributed control concept has to be provided. The fully digital servo level combined with an advanced hydraulic drive system opens new possibilities for varying the position demand and the gain values to increase speed and eliminate vibrations. New sensor concepts are necessary for flexible manipulator structures to increase the accuracy of the overall system. For the large reach manipulator a lightweight construction using modular design principles is necessary to cover the anticipated range of applications.

A 300 dpi prototype light gate array has been delivered and evaluated. It has been incorporated into a customized system and its usefulness in halftone photographic colour printing has been successfully demonstrated, with good uniformity and colour rendering. The device was later fitted into an electrophotographic engine and the tests demonstrated the feasibility of greyscale pictures, using a combination of pulsewidth modulation and spacial dithering. The print bar device showed excellent light transmission, a good contrast ratio (reaching 38:1) and fast switching properties. The basic potential of the PLZT technology has been proven by the project but a revison of the design of the first prototype device (for example, using embedded electrodes to produce a more uniform electrical field) seems necessary.
The most important advantage of this electro-optic printing technology in comparison to the competing approaches (laser, LED, thermotransfer, LC array, ink-jet) is the unique combination it allows of several features:

This is of major importance for predicting the behaviour of radioactive waste storage particularly as regards to the temperature and the pressure that the canisters will have to withstand. The influence of marno anhydritic layers will be studied too.

The experiment is planned to include three tests in separate boreholes at Amélie potash mine (F), with identical heating probes but different types of thermal loadings and backfilling materials.
A prototype heater with an annulus between the heater and the borehole as small as possible (less than 5 mm) was installed in December 1991 in Mine Amelie. After a period of observation of the borehole creeping, the heater was turned on in May 1992. The heating power was a 2.4 kW. After 2 months the heating power was raised up to 4 kW in order to speed up the borehole creeping.

The convergency measurements of the gallery are strongly dependent on the air temperature. For example a five degrees increase of temperature multiplies by a factor 6 theconvergency rate. The horizontal and vertical displacements of the rock salt surrounding the experimental gallery have been measured in several places. Their difference can probably be explained by the influence of the horizontal marno anhydritic layers.

At the end of the first heating step the closure rate was very low. Three days after the increase of power the borehole was in contact with the probe. During the first step the maximum temperature was 120 C on the surface of the probe. During the second step the temperature has reached 200 C at this place and has nearly stabilized. At a distance of 70 cm from the axis of the probe the temperature reached 70 C.

The displacement of the rock salt reached 8 mm in surface and 4 mm at a depth of 2.65 m and nearly zero at a depth of 4.65 m.

It is inherent to this kind of data that these sets tend to become very large, so that the database management system (DBMS) handling them needs to be very efficient. 
This Working Group aimed to fix the precise requirements for such an environment and find solutions to the problems that arise from the specific characteristics of the modelled data.
The impact of object oriented data models and languages on the effective representation and management of spatial data was assessed. Specific aims were to extend and/or modify existing object oriented systems to model and manage geographical information and to find specific solutions for the treatment of spatial data, mainly at the level of how this data is actually stored.

Original data models (both extended relational and graph based) for the representation of spatial data have been proposed and tested at the implementation level. The applicability of the object oriented approach to data modelling to the same problem has been examined. This has led to a better understanding of the power and the potential of different nonrelational approaches to the management of spatial data.

New data structures for the (physical) representation of spatial information have been introduced, with special regard to data structures for secondary memory. An extensive analysis of the efficiency of such spatial data structures has been performed. Such data structures favourably compare with preceding proposals regarding efficiency of access to physical information in different types of spatial queries.

Geometric algorithms have been proposed for relevant problems in spatial data organization and access. Special regard has been given to the study of efficient methods for maintaining information derived from spatial data under dynamic conditions (insertion/deletion of data, moving data) and to the representation of spatial data of different scales and at different levels of detail.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Data management is concerned with two aspects of the data itself: the logical level, which defines how the data is represented and how a user can view and handle the data; and the physical level, which defines how the data is stored on a physical medium, such as a hard disk. For the first aspect, object-oriented data models are considered. These are compared both with each other and with more conventional approaches, such as relational models. The work-plan was to: 
-define an object-oriented data-model for the representation and treatment of geographic data that allows modelling of both the characteristics of the represented entities and their constraints 
-study advanced access methods at the physical level for geometric and descriptive data. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Original data models (both extended relational and graph based) for the representation of spatial data have been proposed and tested at the implementation level. The applicability of the Object Oriented approach to data modeling to the same problem has been examined. This has led to a better understanding of the power and the potential of different non relational approaches to the management of spatial data. 
New data structures for the (physical) representation of spatial information have been introduced, with special regard to data structures for secondary memory. An extensive analysis of the efficiency of such spatial data structures has been performed. Such data structures favorably compare with preceding proposals regarding efficiency of access to physical information in different types of spatial queries.

Economic change is seen as a process and evolutionary theory still needs to be developed to offer a fully satisfactory analytical framework. 

During the first organizational meetings among the different teams of the network, presentations were given on observables at the aggregate level macroeconomic dynamics; dynamics of microentities; methodology of evolutionary modelling. 
With respect to observables at the aggregate level macroeconomic dynamics the main topics discussed were the question of convergence and divergence of technological developments, characterization of national and regional systems of innovation and evolutionary modelling of macrovariations. 
The discussions on the dynamics of microentities focussed on technological change and market dynamics, technological dynamics, indicators and measurements of technological change and taxonomy of learning effects. 

The possibilities of using standard econometric methods for testing evolutionary models were discussed. Many traditional testing methods can be applied to such models, and especially most recent techniques such as time series analysis. However several difficulties are raised by evolutionary models. Operationalization of evolutionary theories was discussed and pointed the need for a clarification of concepts (such as 'trajectory') for practical purposes and comparability in empirical work was identified. 

The international macrodynamics workshop addressed the issues of international trade, growth and technological change, and especially the modelling an econometric aspects of theory in this field. 
The 'technology and market dynamics' workshop concentrated on: 
new firm startups, technology and macroeconomic fluctuations; 
industry level studies; 
technological change and market structure (an evolutionary approach); 
competence and learning in an adaptive model of the firm; 
rapid technology change, organization structure and market structure (some case studies and experiments with a simulation model.

The growth in the quantity and quality of networked systems and the consequent increase in problems concerning complexity, heterogeneity and the diversity of components in such multivendor environments require adequate tools supporting all aspects of networked systems management. Such management tools must be based on a new architecture which maintains a clear distinction between management policy and the resources and activities being managed (ie the managed objects). The interface between the managed objects and the management applications will follow international standards (either existing or currently under development). DOMAINS therefore followed the OSI management model for networks as well as the Open Distributed Processing (ODP) recommendations.
The project uses and object oriented approach for both conceptual modelling (according to the structuring principles) and implementation of management applications. The conceptual model is uniform for managing and managed entities and therefore (recursively) allows managing entities to become managed. A management application is implemented as a distributed object oriented one, running on top of the project platform. This platform supports the structuring principles and provides the backing necessary for object orientation and distribution with particular attention to management requirements. It can be realized on various existing systems.
The project showed that the architecture can support objects ranging from pure networking resources, such as switches, to computing resources such as programs and databases. It established management domains to structure the real-world management task according to the restrictions given by different policy requirements. The object-oriented approach was considered to be an appropriate method for resolving the problems encountered. 

Key components of the DMA were implemented on top of an existing object-oriented system, and served for a demonstrator application to show the management interaction between components. 

The workplan comprised: 

- a requirements analysis 
- the development of an open architecture for domain management 
- the implementation of some generic functions needed for the demonstrator application 
- the setting up of the demonstrator. 

All participating companies consider the results as key for their future products in the area of distributed and networked systems. The major industrial partners consider the results to be directly usable in their product lines. All companies need a standardising platform to allow multivendor systems to be established and managed in a uniform way, and so the project will contribute to standardisation bodies. DOMAINS will also seek to build upon current and proposed ESPRIT initiatives in the area of distributed systems, thus providing a strong contribution to the development of a securely managed 'European Applications Platform'.

A study has been undertaken to obtain, through an interdisciplinary approach, a better knowledge of the dynamics of the eastern Channel and the transport of water and associated materials to the North Sea.

New models have been developed to understand and predict water circulation in the area, on different space and time scales. Forced y a 2-dimensional model of the continental shelf, a 2-dimensional model of the Channel gives instantaneous and long term water flows and computes fluxes of suspended and dissolved matters. A 3-dimensional model of the eastern Channel and southern North Sea has also been built, and exploited in the case of the Strait of Dover.

Experiments have been carried out on rotating tables equipped with a schematic cylindrical basin, in the field of coastal currents with and without density gradient. The modelling is supported by current measurements (high frequency radar, and acoustic Doppler current profiler) and remote sensing in the Dover Strait, and also spacetime observations of the distribution of radiotracers released by the treatment plant at La Hague.

Together with thesephysical approaches, an intensive field measurement programme has been performed, in order to obtain a better estimate of the fluxes of suspended particulate matter and chemicals transferred to the North Sea.
In the hydrodynamics part, the development of a number of models is to be combined (first two 2-d models, then a 3-d model, on decreasing spatial scales) with measurements of the currents in the Straits of Dover (by radar, on the surface, by current recorders and acoustic doppler current profilers at depth) and information derived from the space-time distribution of radioactive tracers from their source onward. Coastal processes modulating the fluxes at the interfaces between the water masses are the subject of an experimental study with a reduced model.

So DECOVALEX is dealing with the study of coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical modelling processes in fracturated rock and associated computer codes.
A computer program has been designed to simulate the processes in a large rock mass with a repository located at depth of about 500 metres. The model is two dimensional, measures 3000 m x 1000 m and contains two sets of intersecting fractures. Three fracture spacings are defined or 25 m, 50 m, 100 m. A non-uniform hydraulic head acts at the ground surface and zero flux is imposed on the bottom and lateral boundaries. The heat flux from the repository is assumed to decay exponentially with time.

A second computer program has been written, consisting of a model of an assemblage of nine blocks, separated by two sets of discontinuities (planar fractures). This model measures 0.75 m x 0.50 m and is confined along all boundaries. The rock mass is subjected to in situ stress and thermal loading as well as hydraulic gradient. No flow and adiabatic conditions are imposed at top and bottom of the model. The heat flux acting along a section of one of the lateral boundaries includes expansion of the rock mass and cause shearing in the model.

To obtain the experimental data needed to quantify the effects of joint deformation and joint conductivity, a testing facility has been designed and built by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. With this apparatus, joints can be closed and sheared under controlled conditions while fluids can be flushed through the joint. Deformations, flow rates and stresses are recorded simultaneously. The boundary stresses applied by flat jacks result in pure normal stress when the same pressure is applied in the flat jack. An increasing shear stress occurs when differential pressure is applied. The proposed coupled stress flow models have input data derived from Stripa studies. The options of linear and nonlinear joint deformability are given and different loading conditions are specified.

It will evaluate market requirements for general-purpose processors across a wide range of applications, and develop the architecture of a new family of European microprocessor components. The architecture will be designed to exploit the technology of the mid-1990s to support high-performance, low-cost low-power or macrocell implementations. The components will exploit novel architectural techniques (such as dynamic instruction scheduling and ultra-fast context switching) to provide virtual processing, virtual memory and virtual communications in scalable general-purpose parallel computers.
The background behind the open microprocessor systems initiative (OMI) is summarized. Concerns about the European information technology industry and the overall strategy are voiced. The work going on in a small pilot project (the microprocessor architecture project) is described. It is intended to explore the areas in more detail so that the OMI initiative would not suffer a gap of 2 years between the conception and strategy and actual projects starting.
Components, machines, macrocells and software conforming to this architecture will be developed within other ESPRIT projects (for example, IPS-2 project 5404, GP-MIMD, will develop components for high-performance computers). It is expected that further projects will exploit the architecture to develop workstations, provide components for embedded systems, and provide macrocell support. 

Particular attention will be paid to minimising the costs of software migration from current architectures and systems. This will be achieved through a combination of processor emulation, the definition of a virtual binary interface, and the adoption and creation of appropriate international standards. 

Bull will lead a workpackage involving the system companies (Olivetti, Acorn, ABC, Siemens, INMOS) to define system requirements and to subsequently evaluate the architecture against these requirements.

The former is based on lambda calculus, and its results and techniques will be used. From the latter will be incorporated pragmatic advantages such as input/output symmetry (ie procedures that do not distinguish between input and output parameters) and non-determinism. The relationship of such a methodology with object-oriented programming was also considered. .
A unified theory and prototype tools were developed for a programming paradigm based on results from mathematical logic. Extensions of these results and techniques were sought that were suitable for computer science use. Recursive processes within the framework of fixed point theory and inductive definitions were also studied. A number of different notions have been carefully analyzed, and relations between different notions have been defined precisely. There have been three main directions: extensions of the Robinson unification algorithm for the synthesis of various kinds of types for lambda terms, extensions of techniques originating with Herbrand to the framework of linear logic, and unification techniques for the subclass of infinite terms known as rational terms. The mechanization of the proof construction process has been studied by defining adequate tactics. Concerning the additive and multiplicative linear logic (AMLL), considered as a tool to address the topic of logic foundations for parallelism and concurrency, a new algorithm for proof construction from a given sequent has been proposed and proved to be correct, complete and terminating. A new model for distributed computation based on Girard's proof-net for linear logic has been proposed. In this model deadlock-free computation of programs is ensured by purely logical criteria. A unified framework has been inspired from this model. A notion of natural encoding motivated by issues in implementation and partial evaluation has been given. By embedding algebraic or relational structures into a combinatory algebra a notion of computation is adjoined to these structures. Problems concerning interpretation of the notion of type as well as solution of equations in this setting have been investigated. Cumulative fixed points have been considered for giving the semantics of so-called weakly monotone programs, a generalization of the well known class of stratified programs. Fixed-point methods and language theore tic tools have been applied to the optimization of recursive queries in logic programs. The connection between logical parameters and complexity properties has been established. With the aim of extending boundedness results to logic programs with negation, some semantics of negation (eg, cumulative, nondeterministic, well founded, stratified) have been studied; almost all of these semantics are shown to be uncomparable, and known boundedness results are proved to be extensible only to stratified programs. A filter domain for strictness analysis of functional higher order languages has been proposed. The axiomatization of the inclusion relation determined by strictness properties has been proved complete with respect to the interpretation of the basic language in domains. Type inference rules cannot be complete (strictness being an undecidable property), but a complete, non-finitary extension of the type inference system has been found. The use of higher-order types has been proposed for recovering the type preserving property and the definitional genericity principle and for capturing the types of the term synthesis and term analysis features of Prolog.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The work followed three approaches, all firmly rooted in mathematical logic: 
-Lambda calculus. Untyped lambda calculus suggests new typing mechanisms and a type-free approach to modularity in functional programming. The well-known Curry-Howard isomorphism establishes a correspondence between proofs and programs and  between proof -theoretic methods and modularity issues in typed functional programming. 
-Linear logic. Linear logic is a very promising foundation for a programming style based on the symmetry of input/output, non-determinism and a logical treatment of control. In order to study time from a proof-theoretic point of view, a variant of linear logic called non-commutative linear logic has been formulated, in which the exchange rule is treated with the same methodological approach as weakening and contraction in linear logic. 
-Fixed-point theory. The recursive aspects of programming are considered in the framework of fixed-point theory and its connection with inductive definitions and formal language theory. This theory will be used in the semantics of programs. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-The unification problem has been investigated both to get a better understanding of it and to extend it to various concerns. A number of different notions, vaguely referred to as unification problems, have been carefully analyzed, and relations betweensuch different notions have been defined precisely. As far as extensions are concerned, there have been three main directions: extensions of the Robinson unification algorithm for the synthesis of various kinds of types for lambda terms, extensions of techniques originating with Herbrand to the framework of linear logic, and unification techniques for the subclass of infinite terms known as rational terms. 
-In the framework of proofs as programs, the mechanization of the proof construction process has been studied by defining adequate tactics. Concerning the additive and multiplicative linear logic (AMLL), considered as a tool to address the topic of logic foundations for parallelism and concurrency, a new algorithm for proof construction from a given sequent has been proposed and proved to be correct, complete and terminating. 
-A new model for distributed computation based on Girard's proof-net for linear logic (interaction nets0 has been proposed. In this model deadlock-free computation of programs is ensured by purely logical criteria. A unified framework has been inspired f rom this model, subsuming well known models of sequential or parallel computations, has been proposed as a general interaction paradigm. A notion of natural encoding motivated by issues in implementation and partial evaluation has been given. 
-By embedding algebraic or relational structures into a combinatory algebra a notion of computation is adjoined to these structures. Problems concerning interpretation of the notion of type as well as solution of equations in this setting have been inves tigated. 
-Cumulative fixed-points have been considered for giving the semantics of so-called weakly monotone programs, a generalization of the well-known class of stratified programs. Fixed-point methods and language theoretic tools have been applied to the optim ization of recursive queries in logic programs. By considering a logic program as a uniform definition on a class of finite structures, the connection between logical parameters and complexity properties has been established. 
-With the aim of extending boundedness results to logic programs with negation, some semantics of negation (e.g. cumulative, nondeterministic, well founded, stratified) have been studied; almost all of these semantics are shown to be uncomparable, and kn own boundedness results are proved to be extensible only to stratified programs.

Type inference rules cannot be complete (stricteness being an undecidable property), but a complete, non finitary extension of the type inference system has been found. 
-The use of higher-order types has been proposed for recovering the type preserving property (type variables in an argument type always occur in the result type) and the definitional genericity pronciple (all occurences of a predicate symbol in the concl usion of a clause have the same type) and for capturing the types of the term synthesis and term analysis features of Prolog.

Interactive multimedia compact discs will soon play an important role. A new publishing industry sector will emerge, in which Europe can play a leading role by exploiting both its technological and cultural strengths. In order to streamline the widespread uptake of the new medium and to optimise the changes for European business, it is essential to harmonise the requirements of all parties involved. The project aims at building bridges between technology providers and technology users. Its main charter is to create optimal conditions for developers and publishers of interactive multimedia titles. Therefore, it is a strongly market driven project.
The full-scale project will result in a high-level Application Programming Interface (API) for CD-based interactive multimedia applications. The API will enable the development of multimedia applications (CDs) which can be used on a variety of platforms (operating systems, processors, CD peripherals). In addition to enabling portability, the API will facilitate continuity (ie independence from new releases of hardware or software) and flexibility (allowing third parties to tailor or to add functionality to applications). 

The preparatory action, OSMOSE-1, is focused on the requirements analysis for the API from various different perspectives. It addresses: 

- related ongoing work in multimedia application standards 
- constraints, requirements and trends in multimedia system platforms (hardware, system software, UIMS, DBMS)

The development in this project is the elaboration of computer automated group technology (CAGT) software. By automating the input from computer aided design (CAD), consisting of features and attributes, human interpretation of engineering drawings during the coding process is excluded. A performing retrieval tool will automate the retrieval of existing similar parts, drawings and manufacturing sequences based on the internal group technology (GT) representation or on a rough sketch on the CAD system. The internal representation stored in a relational database is a successful start to an engineering database with links to process planning, material requirements planning, manufacturing and purchasing.
The principal modules of the system will provide: 

- automatic creation, during a design task on a CAD system, of computer-based internal representations of assemblies, subassemblies and parts, defining their geometrical, functional and production characteristics 
- automatic retrieval, based on their functional or morphological characteristics, of existing similar designs of assemblies, subassemblies and parts, from a rough sketch on the CAD system, or a functional or production-oriented description of a new design 
- automatic retrieval of appropriate operation sequences for manufacturing. 

The automatic generation of internal representations will avoid the need for the time-consuming and inconsistent coding of parts normally experienced with group technology systems. 

The CAGT system will be interfaced to a range of CAD systems. 

Exploitation 

The project's industrial partners will make direct use of the system by applying it to their own manufacturing operations. They expect to achieve more efficient design and process planning, improved usage of their manufacturing equipment through the standardising of processes, and a reduction in inventories. 

The project results will be sold as a software product by Eigner & Partner.

The goal of PANORAMA is to develop an advanced perception and navigation system for autonomous vehicles, enabling automatic path determination and continuous safe motion in partially structured and partially known environments, such as forests, fields and open mines. The project is mainly concerned with navigation in outdoor environments structured with paths or tracks and some natural or nonnatural landmarks.
Specific objectives are to develop a general purpose perception and navigation system suitable for a large range of outdoor application domains, to test project developments and intermediate results gradually with a fully equipped land vehicle used as a system test bench and to demonstrate capabilities of autonomous motion within real application sites.
The test bed land vehicle now features controlled actuation of steering, throttle and brakes and is able to navigate an outdoor industrial site autonomously by dead reckoning. The following perception tasks have been successfully tested: visual beacons detection for relocalization (colour image processing); obstacle detection up to 30 m ahead of the vehicle (using a laser rangefinder); proximity sensing for close range safety, up to 6 m ahead of the vehicle (using ultrasonic sensors).
The first versions of local path planning, environment modelling and perception planning are now running on a workstation and providing simulation tests. They should be partially integrated onboard the land vehicle test bed in the near future.
In addition, the project has issued an original computing hardware architecture that allies the advantages of well known VME-based systems (for interfaces with sensors and actuators) and the high computing power potentialities of transputer based architectures (parallelization of high level processing for modelling, planning and decision processes), enabling an easy upgrading of system performance and a large degree of development flexibility.

- develop a general-purpose perception and navigation system suitable for a large range of outdoor application domains 
- gradually test project developments and intermediate results with a fully equipped land vehicle used as a system test-bench

It will be a scorpion-like machine with a low, enclosed sealed body and articulated legs. The legs will each be fitted with grippers which will enable it to walk or climb vertically on a wide variety of surfaces.  It will also be able to negotiate the transitions between planes, both internally and externally. 

The project has five objectives: 

1. to investigate user requirements and prepare a functional specification; 
2. to make a prototype light, high-power-to-weight ratio, articulated limb climbing robot fitted with grippers for a wide variety of conditions; 
3. to integrate a prototype tele-operated guidance and navigation system with a radiation resistant tele-operated control system; 
4. to explore the design space for either an umbilical cable and intelligent cable reel system, or a self-powering unit with no umbilical; 
5. to design and build a manipulator suited to the robot.
Research is being carried out into the user requirements for an articulated limbed, climbing and walking light mobile machine (ROBVG III) for use in disordered nuclear environments. 
A functional specification has been developed with the users group, based around the published Teleman light mobile research machine outline specification. Also, a prototype leg has been designed, built and tested. In connection with this, control components suitable for high pressure pneumatic systems have been developed. These will provide the power to weight ratio required to match as far as possible the wide user requirements. A second prototype leg made of composite materials is now being produced. Leg movement profile software has been written in C and various radiation tolerant elements of the on board control system have been identified and tested. Most of the sensors have been selected and tested, and development of sensor data processing has been done. Concepts for the graphical user interface and its integration with pilot functions have been established and gripper feet have been designed for some target conditions.
Exploitation
The project is not due to finish until December 1995, so plans for exploitation are by no means advanced. Nevertheless, opportunities to apply the development of a multi-purpose roving vehicle are being followed up, both in nuclear industries inside and outside Europe and in non-nuclear industries within Europe, examples being petrochemical, marine, munitions, etc.
Work to be done 

A single prototype leg and its control system will be manufactured and tested so that leg coordination and command communication software may be developed, before a complete robot is built.  Designs for gripper feet for the limbs will be produced with special consideration to the user requirements.  A light-weight manipulator suitable for mounting on the vehicle will be developed.  Navigational feedback, attitude and positional sensors will be  selected  and developed, and data from these sensors will be processed to provide feedback via a graphical user interface.  Software for specific tasks and the integration of pilot functions will be developed to provide the tele-operator with a suitable control station.  A full evaluation and presentation of choices of cable management and inboard power systems will be undertaken.  In addition, final year student research projects will be carried out at the Universities of Portsmouth, Kaiserslautern and Coimbra. 

Test strategy 

Once the robot chassis and sensor/navigation units have been fully tested in the laboratory, they will be integrated and functionality tests defined by the users group will be undertaken to demonstrate the vehicle in a variety of situations typical of nuclear environments.  A life sized mock-up of the target situation will be made available at Nuclear Electric's existing test facilities.";;;;CSC;Portsmouth Technology Consultants Ltd.;UK;"Nuclear Electric plc;UNIVERSITAET KAISERSLAUTERN;UNIVERSITE LIBRE DE BRUXELLES;University of Portsmouth";"UK;DE;BE";

The primary aim of the project was to develop tools and techniques for applying knowledge based systems technology in real time domains.

The project's major achievement so far is a software prototype in LISP of an environment for building real time knowledge based systems.
A multitasking architecture has been designed, based on the blackboard paradigm, where a control component, a communication manager, a timer and a number of user defined domain agents run as different processes. Agents are created dynamically to react to certain events and communicate through a shared data structure (the blackboard). Agents may have deadlines which are considered when scheduling the execution of the agent processes, in order to guarantee response times. When more than 1 agent is required to solve a particular problem, the application developer can predefine sequences or even plans of agents activations. A time map manager has been developed to handle temporal constraints and relationships between future variables values (predictions). These predictions are used by domain agents to do some 'advance work' when time is available. Validation scenarios for the new functionalities have been developed and are currently evolving into the final demonstrator, an oil refinery process control application. A runtime version of the architecture in C/C\\ is under implementation. This C runtime will be faster than its LISP counterpart in the development environment, and it will include its own memory management algorithms in order to comply with the real time constraints of the demonstrator.
The project has also produced methodological guidelines, collected into an application methodology handbook.
The project was to produce definitions, specifications and prototypes of various techniques, to be eventually integrated into a toolkit for the efficient development, deployment and maintenance of knowledge-based modules embeddable into real-time applications. Research areas of particular interest include progressive reasoning techniques, which are identified as a key element to provide guaranteed response time, as well as temporal reasoning and coherence management mechanisms. The methodological work is mainly focussed on the implications of real-time issues on the modelling and development of knowledge-based systems. 

A demonstrator system in the area of process control has been chosen to validate both the toolkit and the methodology. Its components exhibit various real-time characteristics in order to demonstrate that the technology is flexible enough to span a large domain of operations. By the end of a follow-on project, 7805, the set of tools and the methodology it will provide should increase the range of applications in which real-time knowledge-based systems could be integrated, thus increasing the market size for both this kind of products and the applications built on top of them.";;;;;Thomson CSF;FR;"CRIN;COMPUTAS EXPERT SYSTEMS;Marconi Command and Control Systems;UNIVERSITAD POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA;Syseca SA;GRUPO DE MECANICA DEL VUELO;Etnoteam S.p.a.";"FR;NO;UK;ES;IT";

The systems architecture and application environments will be selected to meet the needs of SMEs, and the testbeds chosen will also be largely representative of this type of enterprise.

User needs are very varied, resulting from different manufacturing environments, levels of application and degrees of other EDP systems support. For a shop-floor control system to be adaptable to all these needs, the system architecture must be: 

- open, to allow interfacing within multi-vendors systems 
- modular, to allow optimum adaptation to present and future user requirements 
- use accepted standards for operating systems, user interfaces, databases, communications networks and protocols, etc. 

In all these areas, relevant developments within ESPRIT, especially in AMICE (projects 688 and 5288) will be considered in the conceptual design of the system. 

SFC systems are intended to assist the workforce in taking over more responsible work. Thus their installation must not only be permitted by the workers, but be acknowledged as real improvement and enrichment. This requires some efforts with respect to the involvement of the workforce, where the project will draw on significant experiences gained with the introduction of similar systems at the Mercedes-Benz company. 

The main objectives are to: 

- provide efficient support in shop-floor planning, monitoring and control 
- achieve better throughput and delivery times, resource utilisation and adaptability to customer needs 
- provide a more open system than presently available, that will be future-safe and allow re-use of its constituent building-blocks

A study was made of the effects of protracted, low dose occupational exposure to mixed organic solvents and to toluene on the higher nervous functions. New solvent specific tests (ie a subjective symptoms questionnaire and a computerized neurobehavioural test battery) were developed. 

In a number of countries, mainly Austria, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, mixed solvent exposure was deemed a relevant issue while Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom expressed preference for the study of toluene exposure, particularly in view of defining a no observed effect level (NOEL). A number of countries believed that both mixed solvents and toluene exposure are areas of interest. 

The achievements of the initial study comprise: 
development of a questionnaire specially directed to collect solvent related subjective symptoms; 
development of a computerized test battery specially designed to detect solvent related changes in the neurobehavioural functions; 
performance of 2 courses held at TNO Medical Biological Laboratories, The Netherlands, on Neurobehavioural Methodology and Environmental and Biological Monitoring (these courses were aimed at having participants agree on adequate common theoretical and practical procedures as to how to perform the study); 
performance of common exercises on the administration of the newly developed computerized neurobehavioural battery. 

The provisional software of the computerized battery is now ready in its core form and is being distributed to participating groups together with hardware parts needed to operate the programme. The results of the preparatory activity now permit the onset of the full concerted action.
Because of the complexity of conducting a large-scale study involving 17 participating groups from 9 EC and 3 COST countries and the need to utilize sensitive and specific methods to detect early changes in the neurobehavioural functions related to long-term, low-dose occupational exposure to organic solvents, it was decided to promote a preparatory activity on this topic in order to perform the full concerted action.
On these grounds, the preparatory activity focused mainly on the following aspects:
1 to define the feasibility of the study in terms of actual participation of individual countries;
2 to develop the protocols for the final study;
3 to perfect methods sufficiently sensitive to detect solvent-related changes in the neurobehavioural functions;
4 to run common exercises with the application of the protocol agreed upon so as to guarantee a more homogeneous administration and interpretation of results.

This phase has to be considered a necessary step to better and more homogeneously approach the final concerted action the aims of which are as follows:
1 the assessment of the different types of exposure to organic solvents in the participating countries;
2 the assessment of the amount of people occupationally exposed to organic solvents in the participating countries;
3 the undertaking of the scientific investigation of the chronic CNS effects due to occupational exposure to organic solvents, with a particular emphasis on protracted, low dose exposure, the detection of early effects and the definition of NOEL.

The most modern protection for end-to-end data or message encryption uses public key methods, as represented by the RSA or Fiat Shamir Algorithms. State-of-the-art products use large-area silicon chips, which have the disadvantage of high cost at low speed; their integration into chipcards is impossible. 

The CRYPTOCARD project aims to find new semiconductor-based solutions and to demonstrate the effectiveness of employing a secure chipcard with a dedicated coprocessor for fast asymmetric encryption procedures. This solution will strengthen the use of open system architectures as proposed in the ITHACA projects (2121 and 2705).
For electronic data processing (EDP) the confidentiality and integrity of private messages has to be ensured by authentication means. Symmetric methods are not appropriate for key distribution over large communication networks. However, public key crypto (PKC) systems enable key management. With these asymmetric algorithms only one of two keys is kept secret. Use of a microcontroller and an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) embedded into a smart card is the most secure method of preserving this key. Because of the high computational complexity of asymmetric algorithms, a dedicated crypto-coprocessor was developed. It serves as a high speed arithmetic unit for modular multiplications. The Siemens component SLE44C200 is based on an advanced coprocessor architecture. With 4 cycles of a 140 bit-parallel arithmetic unit (AU) it executes one 540 bit RSA-decryption in about 0.4 s at 3.57 MHz. In 1 um complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology the Coprocessor's chip area is less than 5 square millimetres. For very large scale integration (VLSI) implmentations it is integrated together with a microprocessor (including 256 byte RAM), 8 kilobyte ROM, and 2 kilobyte EEPROM into one single chip. With application specific software the SLE 44C200 becomes a multifunctional processor chip card suitable for a broad range of applications, eg banking card, access control, and Fax. Further flexibility is attributed to a highly regular and modular design. With this property different security levels can be satisfied by an increased key length. A hybrid concept was chosen in order to combine higher baud rates with improved security.

The demand for secure data systems is increasing, and hardware and software protection is needed to improve current passwork solutions. The most modern protection for end to end data or message encryption uses public key methods, as represented by the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) or Fiat Shamir algorithms. State of the art products use large area silicon chips, which have the disadvantage of high cost at low speed; their integration into chipcards is impossible. The project aims to find new semiconductor based solutions and to demonstrate the effectiveness or employing a secure chipcard with a dedicated coprocessor for fast asymmetric encryption procedures. Beside the generic information technology, special applications of the chipcard integrated circuit (IC) will be in computer cards and bank cards. One important goal is to achieve high flexibility in that a variety of algorithms (such as public key methods, symmetric methods and zero knowledge algorithms) can be handled by the new chip.

The first silicon of the crypto coprocessor has been successfully tested. The results are: RSA encryption/decryption of 540 bit word length is done in less than 0.3 ms at % MHz internal clock rate. The active area is small enough to use the chip in a chip card. The chips of the coprocessor are available in dual in line (DIL) packages. Crypto IC chips (SLE 44C20) and the emulator and demonstrator hardware and software are available as is a basic application program.
The two main partners (Siemens for the semiconductor work and Bull for the application) will share their experience with all interested partners in the ITHACA team. 

The results will be open to the European information industry to set standards for the encryption and for user-friendly software to be implemented on the microprocessor chips. Beside the generic information technology, special applications of the chipcard IC will be in: 

- computer cards (access, identification, authentication, electronic signature) 
- bank cards (point-of-sale, ATM, home banking)

When the impurities act as 'vortex pinning centres', the critical current of the superconducting material can be enhanced. To do so, a thorough theoretical understanding of the effects of impurities needs to be developed.
The effects of magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities on the properties of high temperature superconductors were studied. Impurities were introduced into bulk samples, single crystals and 20 to 200 um thick films.

Monophasic zinc and iron substituted yttrium barium copper oxide bulk material has been synthesized withless than 0.1% impurity phases. Structural and microscopic characterization have been made on this material and intentionally prepared multiphase material. Solubility limits, new phases, twin and tweed structures have been studied in relation to the substitution.

Point contact and tunnelling investigations of the gap have been made together with yttrium barium copper oxide (IR) studies allowing gap and temperature dependence studies.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on zinc substituted yttrium barium copper oxide indicate that zinc impurities depress superconductivity without major modification of the hole doping and of the temperature dependence of the homogenous susceptibility, which is therefore not a direct manifestation of superconductivity. Local moments induced by zinc are evidenced and might play a role in the pair breaking phenomenon. This is correlated by our by our latest results on transport properties, Hall effect, magnetoresistance and zero field resistivity studied in relation to the zinc impurity substitution.

By inelastic neutron diffraction studies in the iron doped bismuth calcium copper oxide compounds, the coexistence of superconductivity and magentizm has been observed together with the appearance of a gap in the magnetic excitations spectrum.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The effect of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities was studied in various samples of polycrystalline material (prepared by powder and sol gel techniques) and single crystals (prepared by flux methods). 
The modification of the crystal phases, stoichiometry, and the appearance of new superconducting phases were to be measured and correlated with the incorporation of impurities. Depending on their position in the superconducting phase, state of ionisation and electronic interaction with other elements present in the structure, measurements of fundamental superconducting properties can convey important information for improving the theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. 
The samples were characterised with respect to: 
-physico-chemical properties (stoichiometry, crystalline and microstructural characterisation) using various characterisation techniques 
-superconducting properties in relation to electrical resistivity and critical current, FIR absorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) absorption and relaxation studies. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Monophasic Zn and Fe substituted YBaCuO bulk material has been synthesized with less than 0.1% impurity phases. Structural and microscopic characterization have been made on this material and intentionally prepared multiphase material. Solubility limits, new phases, twin and tweed structures have been studied in relation to the substitution. 
Point contact and tunnelling investigations of the gap have been made together with IR studies allowing gap and its temperature dependence studies. 
NMR studies on Zn substituted YBCO indicate that Zn impurities depress superconductivity without major modification of the hole doping and of the T dependence og the homogeneous susceptibility, which is therefore not a direct manifestation of superconduct ivity. Local moments induced by Zn are evidenced and might play a role in the pair breaking phenomenon. This is correlated by our latest results on transport properties, Hall effect, magnetoresistance and zero field resistivity studied in relation to the Zinc impurity substitution.

POTENTIAL 
This Action is leading to the theoretical understanding of the role of impurities or clusters of impurities on the basic properties of high Tc suprconductors, and also of their role on the current transport and the mechanisms of dissipation. This knowledge will be used in the preparation of high critical current superconducting material.

It is optimised as an entire system rather than optimizing the individual system components alone. The vision system is designed for performing quality assurance inspections in an industrial concrete tile fabrication environment.
An integrated, flexible and robust computer integrated manufacture (CIM) vision system has been developed. It has been optimized as an entire system rather than optimizing the individual system components alone. The vision system is designed for performing quality assurance inspections in an industrial concrete tile fabrication environment. 

Novel optical components, sensor architecture and processing electronics, incorporating recent progress in the field such as random access to the region of interest, have been constructed. The zoom lens is digitally controlled and has an appropriate tiltable mirror in front in order to move the optical axes. The computation time is reduced by an optical implementation of the Gaussian convolution with a diffractive element, ie a computer generated hologram. The latter is electrically switchable using liquid crystal technology. A novel dynamic image sensor offers random access of pixels, selectable exposure time and frame rate, as well as programmable image resolution through on-chip charge summation capabilities. Communication with the CIM environment is ensured with bidirectional lines with through the lens (TTL) levels, available on the CIVIS optocontroller card, and standard interfaces such as RS-232 and Ethernet adapters. 

The integrated approach adopted involved a careful adaptation of the submodules to each other. Some of the image preprocessing steps are done in the optical domain and on the sensor chip in order to achieve optimum performance. The system achieves active vision by responding to changing situations by a laboratory test bed, simulating closely the industrial environment. Although the demonstration of the system was in the field of surface inspection of concrete tiles, its potential for robotics applications has also been investigated.";;;;;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum;BE;"PAUL-SCHERRER-INSTITUTE ZURICH LTD;Optec;ADEC ROBOT;I2S;KRONIMUS;FRAUNHOFER-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.";"CH;IT;FR;DE";
8671;2705;ITHACA-2;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Integrated Toolkit for Highly Advanced Computer Applications;09/01/1990;08/01/1993;;"The aim of the ITHACA project is to develop an integrated application support system based on the object-oriented programming approach. The system envisaged will incorporate a wide range of features designed to: 

- ensure reusability at various levels of application development and 
- guarantee a high application quality. 

In addition to the benefits to be gained from the object-oriented approach, the use of existing and emerging standards will play a decisive role in this context.
Object oriented systems constitute an ideal means of increasing software productivity and improving software quality. This technology offers the clarity and flexibility required to develop highly complex, large scale software systems. The integrated toolkit for highly advanced computer applications (ITHACA) environment will enable an extensive range of such systems to be produced quickly and reliably.

Flexible, configurable applications can be viewed as collections of reusable objects conforming to standard interfaces together with scripts that bind these objects together to perform certain tasks. Scripting encourages a component oriented approach to application development in which frameworks of reusable components (objects and scripts) are carefully engineered in an evolutionary software life cycle, with the ultimate goal of supporting application construction largely from these interchangeable, prefabricated components. The activity of constructing the running application is supported by a visual scripting tool that replaces the textual paradigm of programming with a visual paradigm of direct manipulation and editing of both application and user interface components. We have implemented a prototype, called Vista, which supports scripting of both the behaviour and the user interface of applications. Vista supports the visualization and graphical linking of components selected from an extensible component set. Scripts can be interactively executed, saved, and encapsulated as components for use in other scripts. Vista provides a single, hard-wired dataflow-based scripting model.
The underlying objective is to create a platform which will enable a wide range of applications to be developed quickly, reliably and at a low cost, an approach which is reflected to some degree in a number of existing developments, but which, as a result of its innovative nature of object technology and the leading-edge methods involved, has yet to gain a firm foothold in the marketplace. 

The system will consist of the following components: 

- object-oriented kernel 
- object-oriented software information base 
- applications development environment 
- applications support environment 

The system will comprise a persistent, object-oriented programming language, a fully integrated structurally object-oriented database system, as well as a runtime system geared to this. The system kernel is designed in such a way that it will be capable of integrating both object-oriented programming languages and procedural languages. A particularly innovative feature of the kernel is the concept of persistency. This enables objects to be stored permanently, a feature which other object-oriented languages have as yet failed to provide. In addition, application developers will be provided with an easy-to-use filtering and browsing system, a high level, interactive multi-language debugger, a configuration tool and a graphical user interface. 

The object-oriented software information base will be used to store software information which constitutes the basic building blocks with which the developer works. It will cooperate closely with the tools of the application development environment. Particular consideration will be given to providing support for an object-oriented life-cycle and methodology geared towards streamlining the configuration process called for by the applications. 

The information stored in the software information base will be organised in the form of generic application frames and will be selected interactively with the aid of a selection tool. During the early development phase, the programmer will also be supported by a requirement collection and specification tool which, together with detailed user specifications, will serve to specialise the generic frames to produce specific application frames. The software components selected will be customised by means of a combination of programming and scripting. A visual scripting tool will be used to graphically connect visual representations of objects and to interactively construct the applications. 

The application support environment will provide application users with an advanced user interface, an activity coordination facility and a management system in order to offer assistance in modelling cooperative task solutions. 

Two procedures will be employed to validate the environment. Firstly, a bootstrap technique will be used to develop the entire system in a single unique language, the aim of this being to prove that the environment is suitable for system programming. Secondly, several sample applications, which include a generic office model for use in a wide range of application scenarios, will be developed to illustrate the usefulness of the environment for application development.";;;;;Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG;DE;"BULL SA;FORTH RESEARCH CENTER OF CRETE;UNIVERSITAET ZURICH-IRCHEL;Università degli Studi di Udine;TECNICS EN AUTOMATIZACIO D'OFICINES SA;Consorzio Milano Ricerche;CMSU-COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UNIT;IFATEC;SQL DATABANKSYSTEME GMBH;Technische Universität Dresden;Datamont Feruzzi Group SpA;University of Dublin;GENERALDIREKTION PTT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;Politecnico di Milano;Delphi SpA;GIP Altair;UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE";"FR;EL;CH;IT;ES;DE;IE";

These will allow a designer to prove formally the correctness of a design, evaluate its testability at a high level of abstraction, and assess its complexity in terms of its silicon implementation. These tools will operate at a very high level of abstraction, allowing a designer to make reasoned decisions about architectural choices. The new tools, rather than constituting an architecture compiler, will consist of a set of advisers that provide information on such design issues as correctness, testability, and complexity.
The project aims to provide a set of architectural level design methodologies and prototype design support tools. This project will also investigate the feasibility of building computer aided design (CAD) tools based on a set of high level advisers.
There have been 2 major lines of workon formal methods. The first focuses on developing algebraic representations of specifications and components and techniques for reasoning about them. The second line of work has been based on Abstract Hardware's LAMBDA/DIALOG verification tools, and has involved training the other industrial partners in their use and collaborative working on some actual industrial problems in order to devbleop the tools and their interfaces.
Prototype software has been developed to perform test pattern generation for 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional regular arrays, binary tree architectures and some commonly used very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit blocks (adder, decoder, shifter) from a graph description. Algorithms have been developed for testability analysis of array architectures and the graphical analysis of arrays at a variety of levels of abstraction has been investigated. A knowledge acquisition process for collecting and formalizing testability rules has been undertaken together with a study of available expert system shells prior to the construction of a testability adviser. Fault mapping rules for systolic and semisystolic arrays of different interconnection topologies have been formalized. A representation at the functional level has been defined for sequential machines and associated faults, together wilth a test procedure allowing full functional fault coverage to be obtained. Prototype software has been developed, including the definition of abstract data structures, to describe systems under test. The insertion of testability rules for regular structures into the selected expert system shell has been completed. A C environment for the evaluation of the conditions associated w ith these rules has been partially developed. A taxonomy of design for testability techniques has been started and a literature survey and interviews undertaken to extract the rules used in current design flow. This information will be formalized for inclusion in the testability adviser.
Activity on complexity analysis has focused on the formal definition of data flow graph models (both general and iterative) and on the analysis and manipulation of these models for the synthesis of alternative architectures. The analysis of architectural and technological requirements derived from diode function generator (DFG) models has commenced in order to verify design feasibility. Considerable care has been taken to ensure that the project utilizes a unified graph representation across the above 3 strands of work.
Moreover, such advisers can be technology-independent, permitting a final design to be implemented in various microelectronics technologies, depending upon further considerations (second sourcing, etc.) that do not strictly relate to architecture design constraints. Thus designs can be optimised at high-level prior to choosing a specific microelectronics technology for its implementation. 

The project will provide: 

- Further development of formal proving methods to meet the demands of high-complexity architecture design. 
- Formal proving methods at the logical level, and a problem reformulation system to move up and down levels. 
- Methods for evaluating the testability of complex digital architectures, starting from a high-level representation. 
- Techniques for generation and evaluation at high level of alternative architectures.";;;;;Brunel University;UK;"Italtel Società Italiana Telecomunicazioni SpA;GEC Avionics;Politecnico di Milano;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY";"IT;UK";

This requires the development of a new: conceptual framework, method for expressing usability principles, design method and delivery system.  

The developments must be compatible with usage research synthesis within RACE (eg the URM and REMUS projects) and with the development of international standards (eg ISO, ETSI). 
The aim of the project is to provide usability principles for broadband multimedia service integration. This requires the development of a new:
conceptual framework;
method for expressing usability principles;
design method and delivery system.

The focus of usability is on the design of those aspects of the system which affect the achievement, by human communicating entities, of their work goals. Usability principles are parameterised with respect to task, user, service and performance.

Achievements of the project were:
completion of models of MMMADP system based upon prototypes;
completion of evaluation and analysis of the data of the pilot MMADP system, which provided some unforeseen candidate integration principles;
completion of the first set of generic broadband integration principles to be verified by evaluation;
completion of first set of emulated integrated broadband communications (IBC) services, based upon the independent video, audio and databases;
provision of a conceptual framework for IBC service usability within which intergration principles can be locates;
development of a user-centered design method to allow top down system specification from user requirements;
development of the enabling states analysis technique for top level interface specification;
development of an evaluation methodology to assist designers in the application of integration principles to specific decision points in the development of IBC systems.
Technical Approach  

The focus of usability is on the design of those aspects of the system which affect the achievement, by human communicating entities, of their work goals. Usability principles are parameterised with respect to task, user, service and performance.  In addition, since they are prescriptive, they are associated with a rationale and a validity.  If abstract descriptions of parameters are inserted in a principle, the prescription is generic.  More detailed 'concrete' parameters will yield specific prescriptions.  

The principles are located at various stages in a design method, based on the enabling states approach. The enabling tasks are described, to create the enabling states, and used as the technical basis for intelligent user-service interfaces.  Both the principles and the design method have been developed from pilot studies, task analysis, prototyping and evaluation of multimedia interfaces, and are given to designers as a software package.  This approach has been used for the R1038 MCPR prototype.

Expected Impact  
The implementation of a broadband network in Europe will create a very large market for terminals and terminal software.  If European companies are to compete in this market then a European user interface technology basis must be created.  Part of this technology should be the establishment of a framework for the integration of usability engineering principles into broadband terminal design.  This would enable the development of a first generation of terminals for the European market and the anticipation of future developments such as intelligent terminals.  GUIDANCE is aimed at providing that framework.

-methods for problem domain requirements capture 
-a specification and a programming language 
-a machine architecture and language 
-a compiler from the programming language to that machine 
-a suitable kernel supporting the execution of compiled programs. 
PROCOS also aimed to design the formal semantics of specification, programming and machine languages, contribute to principles of decomposing the development of such systems into smaller, more manageable tasks, and develop techniques for ensuring the integrity and stability of interfaces between the different components of a system.
Programming methodologies were studied for systems that must interact correctly, uncorruptedly and in real time with an environment, no matter how that environment behaves. Systems software needed to support such applications (compilers and operating system kernals, for example) was investigated, together with principles and techniques for the development of provably correct software, ranging from the design of machine languages to methods for capturing the applications requirements.

Techniques for capturing the requirements for real time, embedded, safety critical systems have been clarified, and the proper roles of equipment and component systems engineering are becoming apparent.

A novel duration calculus for real time specification has been proposed, and its mathematics studied and its applicability tested. More conventional specification, programming machine languages have been given firm semantics, and several novel transformation rules between them have been studied and applied. A novel rapid compiler protoyping technique, as well as production quality compiler development techniques, are being studied and applied. Large manual proofs of correctness of compilation have been carried through.

Throughout the work, a better understanding has emerged of overall design techniques for interfacing the various components of complex digital hardware and sofware systems.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach taken was based on decomposing the ultimate goal into a set of subgoals, as outlined above. 
To achieve these subgoals a theoretical study has been made of what is meant by the safety criticality of embedded systems. Insights gained in this study are being evaluated through individual case-studies of particular systems, such as auto-pilots, gas burners and railway systems. 
The experience gained with these case-studies have been used to define requirements specification, programming, and machine languages with formal semantics. The soundness of rules for the transformation of specifications to programs and of programs to mac hine code (compilation) have been established. A novel interval logic, the Duration Calculus, has been developed and used to specify and reason about real-time requirements. OCCAM 2 with the Inmos transputer has been adopted as the underlying machine for programs and programming languages. Refinement techniques are employed for the verification of transformation rules, and a variety of other techniques for compiler and kernel development.

8219;3109;PROMPT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Programme For MOS Processing Technology;01/07/1989;31/03/1992;;"PROMPT aimed to study: 
-the influence of H2O traces in an O2 ambient on oxidation mechanisms and kinetics in the thin-film (4-40 nm) regime 
-the influence of silicon surface conditions on the oxidation of silicon (crystallography, damage, impurities, etc) 
-the incorporation of impurities (eg H) during Al or poly-Si deposition to form MOS contacts 
-the electrical properties of MOS test-sets, made under the conditions used above, correlated with growth conditions.
An improved understanding of the influence of material processing variables on the electrical characteristics of metal oxide silicon (MOS) structures was sought. An ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) processing facility was used to provide the ability to grow dry oxides on silicon and to deposit clean metal and polysilicon contacts. Surface and interface characterization techniques were applied. Understanding the processing variables will lead to improved fabrication techniques for ultra large scale semiconductor devices.

An ultraviolet (UV)/ozone dry cleaning station has been added to the cluster tool and a design study for the addition of a hydrogen atom source dry cleaning stage has been completed.

The effects of wet chemical cleaning procedures on MOS breakdown strength have been investigated. The cleaning procedures leave differing amounts of carbon on the native oxide produced during cleaning with levels below the detection limit. Little difference in MOS breakdown strength was observed providing the oxide growth step of fabrication was carried out with the native oxide intact. If the native oxide was desorbed by heating in UHV the MOS capacitors failed unless the desorption temperature was high and even then they perform poorly. Silicon carbide formation during oxide desorption was a serious problem for some cleaning procedures, while even when it was absent the silicon surface roughness was high and degraded the MOS devices.

A parallel study in conventional processing showed a similar correlation between silicon surface roughness and MOS breakdown performance.

The fabrication of metal contacts to silicon dioxide in UHV has shown that with appropriate attention to in situ removal of surface absorbates, improvements to contact adhesion strength of an order of magnitude can be achieved.

A recent study of gate oxide breakdown strength using a conduction atomic force microscope indicated that breakdown occurs even in the highest quality material, at small loca lized defects.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
MOS test samples containing capacitor sets from 100 to 1000 micron diameter were fabricated on 15 mm square silicon samples in the UHV processing facility. Various processing stages, such as in situ cleaning, oxidation, and contact deposition, were carrie d out. The samples are then removed to a clean-room environment for photolithography and etch patterning. MOS test-sets made by conventional clean-room atmospheric furnace oxidation and contact deposition were examined for comparison with UHV processing.  The examination of surfaces and interfaces by low and medium energy ion scattering, nuclear reaction analysis (for 18O and 16O and H) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) have been carried out. These measurements are an essential part of the study to characterise the various process stages used in MOS fabrication. 
In addition to these MOS processing studies, investigations of fundamental aspects of oxidation mechanisms and oxidation kinetics have been undertaken. These studies rely on the use of 18O and 16O isotopes as the oxidising ambient to give a means of high-accuracy nuclear reaction oxide thickness determination and the determination of the depth distribution. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-The UHV Cluster Tool we have built to fabricate MOS test sets on 15mm by 15mm Si samples has functioned effectively. The cluster tool in situ medium energy ion scattering and scanning tunnelling microscope diagnostic tools have been upgraded. A UV/ozone  'dry-cleaning' station has been added to the cluster tool and a design study for the addition of a H atom source 'dry-cleaning' stage has been completed. The in-situ diagnostics and 'dry-cleaning' process stage have proved invaluable in our MOS process s tudies. 
-The effects of wet chemical cleaning procedures (HF, RCA, Shiraki, etc.) before loading Si into the UHV Cluster Tool and UV/Ozone cleaning in the Cluster Tool on MOS breakdown strength have been investigated. The cleaning procedures leave differing amou nts of carbon on the 'native-oxide' produced during cleaning with levels below the detection limit for our Cluster Tool ion scattering diagnostics in the UV/Ozone case. However, little difference in MOS breakdown strength (ca 13MV/cm) was observed providi ng the oxide growth step of fabrication was carried out with the 'native-oxide' intact. If the 'native-oxide' is desorbed by heating in UHV the MOS capacitors fail unless the desorption temperature is high (1150C) and even so they perform poorly (ca 10MV /cm). The STM Cluster Tool diagnostic showed that SiC formation during oxide desorption is a serious problem for some cleaning procedures, while even when it is absent the Si surface roughness is high and degrades the MOS devices. 
-A parallel study in conventional processing also showed a similar correlation between Si surface roughness and MOS breakdown performance. Evidence was also found in this case that metallic contamination was correlated with reduced breakdown, either beca use it leads to surface roughening or because rough surfaces trap metals; more work is required to understand this. 
-The fabrication of metal contacts to SiO2 in UHV has shown that, with appropriate attention to in-situ removal of surface absorbates, improvements to contact adhesion strength of about an order of magnitude can be achieved. 
-A recent study of gate oxide breakdown strength using a conducting atomic force microscope indicates that breakdown occurs, even in the highest quality material, at small localised defects. This aspect of our research is at an early stage but indicatesthat gate oxide reliability is still limited by our process defects rather than by the 'intrinsic' dielectric strength of the oxide. One thus deduces that improvements in gate oxide reliability are possible, perhaps by improving surface roughness or metalimpurity levels. 
POTENTIAL 
The results of the ultra clean processing investigations will enable the development of improved VLSI fabrication techniques to be made. The PROMPT Action has already led to an improved understanding of the relation between process variables and the consequent electrical performance of MOS structures. The prospect for further improvements, particularly in understanding the role of surface roughness at both the Si and SiO2 interfaces is encouraging. 
The experience gained on process research with the UHV Cluster Tool is expected to provide useful input for the design and use of the next generation of Ultra Clean Cluster Tool equipment for VLSI fabrication.

Generally speaking, industry still needs evidence that formal methods can be used in large applications in practice. The aim of the LACOS project is to establish and demonstrate formal methods, specifically RAISE, as a viable industrial technique in the scalable production of large, correct IT systems. The effect (compared with current methods) will be: 

- more problems discovered in the early stage of the life-cycle 
- greater assurance that the design process will not compromise functional properties established in the initial specification 
- more time being spent on early stages of the life-cycle (requirements, specification and design) and less on the later (translation to code, testing and maintenance).

For serious applications much higher factors are required. This Action aimed to: 
-improve the noise reduction factor of existing squeezing systems, whose operation is still far from optimal 
-investigate noise reduction in existing systems in regimes of operation other than the usual ones, and to search for new squeezing systems 
-explore materials which would be relevant for applications, anticipating the advent of a new device, the 'squeezer' 
-assess the potential of reduced noise light-beams for high-sensitivity measurements and information technology applications.
Optical systems with reduced noise were investigated. It is now possible to reduce the noise in optics below the 'shot noise' which is due to the corpuscular nature of light. Work focussed on systems which can efficiently reduce noise, such as optoelectronic and nonlinear optical devices, and assessed their potential for future practical use. Optical communication and information technology applications are foreseen.

Most results have been obtained on squeezing in parametric and second harmonic generation, namely:
a monolithic device for second harmonic generation yielding 40% intensity squeezing;
improved operation of the parametric oscillator (86% noise reduction on twin beams);

a new theoretical method of modelling the propagation of nonclassical light;

As far as optical bistability is concerned, theoretical studies and assessments of nonlinear materials are well underway. The main outcomes so far are:
new theories for 1-photon and 2-photon processes that clarifies the differences between 1-photon and 2-photon nonlinearities for squeezing and the role of atomic noise;
an overall evaluation of available nonlinear materials;
a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement scheme which opens the way to noiseless optical tapping.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Quantum noise reduction, or squeezing, can be achieved by various kinds of systems involving non-linear optical processes or optical sources excited by low-noise pumping processes. The Action examined three different methods of producing squeezed light: -Parametric generation and second harmonic generation. The processes which involve the frequency conversion of an incoming light-beam also have a profound effect on its fluctuations and produce various kinds of squeezed light: with reduced intensity nois e, with reduced phase noise, or 'twin beams', ie beams exhibiting quantum intensity correlation. 
-Optical bistability. Non-linear optical cavities can switch between high and low light transmission when monitored by small optical signals. The quantum noise is also strongly modified and can be either phase-squeezed or intensity-squeezed at the output of the cavity. 
-In some optoelectronic devices, such as laser diodes, the flow of emitted photons can be controlled by regulating the pumping current. In such cases intensity-squeezed light is emitted. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
Most results have been obtained on squeezing in parametric and second harmonic generation, namely: 
-a monolithic device for second harmonic generation yielding 40% intensity squeezing 
-improved operation of the parametric oscillator (86% noise reduction on twin beams) 
-a thorough theoretical understanding of the quantum fluctuations in the parametric oscillator, in both the three-wave and four-wave mixing configuration 
-a new theoretical method of modelling the propagation of non-classical light 
-low light power parametric generation in single pass providing up to 60% quantum noise reduction on twin beams. Demonstration of secure communication based on quantum properties of photon pairs, and of a system for quantum cryptography (patented). 
As far as optical bistability is concerned, theoretical studies and assessments of non-linear materials are well underway. The main outcomes so far are: 
-New theories for one and two-photon processes that clarifies the differences between one- and two-photon non-linearities for squeezing and the role of atomic noise. 
-an overall evaluation of available non-linear materials 
-a quantum non demolition (QND) measurement scheme which opens the way to noiseless optical tapping. 
POTENTIAL 
With the rapid advances in the theoretical understanding of squeezed light and its generation, and with the prospect of getting squeezing factors of over 90% within a few years, the application of squeezed light to practical purposes, such as high-precision measurements, optical communication and information technology, now lies within reach. 
Further progress in squeezing factors and the implementation of communication schemes using various kinds of squeezed light strongly depend on the development of optical nonlinear materials and devices.

The SUBSOITEC project aimed to develop high-performance silicon on insulator (SOI) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies for future very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits, which, while competitive with standard bulk CMOS processes, are compatible with them and offer the inherent advantages of SOI technologies. The project evaluated a complete SOI/CMOS process with 0.7 micron design rules. The programme included development work on silicon implanted oxide (SIMOX) SOI substrates, on the 0.7 micron SOI technology, on device and physics modelling, on design, and on the test and characterization of complex VLSI demonstrators. The work performed in the area of materials fabrication and device evaluation yielded excellent results that compare favourably to work done outside this project. The SOI substrates are among the best available world wide, even for substrates with very thin top silicon thicknesses. The compatibility of SOI processes with standard bulk CMOS technology was considered as a major goal. The portability of bulk design to SOI was studied and implemented. The main difficulties (such as electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection devices and the absence of substrate contacts) are now solved. The ability to realize complex VLSI circuits on SOI with 0.7 micron design rules will be demonstrated, and evaluation of the industrial aspect will be achieved in a comparison of a design in a CMOS SOI with a CMOS bulk process with the same design rules, and by several SOI demonstrators including a 64 k static random access memory (SRAM) and 2 custom chips.
CMOS circuits with deep sub-micron geometries require very complex and expensive processes on bulk silicon. An acceptable challenger to bulk Si is SOI material which allows, in principle, a significant reduction of the number of process steps leading to an enhancement of the yield of complex VLSI chips and a reduction in cost. Two other advantages of CMOS on SOI are the reduction of parasitic capacitance (which increases circuit speed), and immunity towards radiation and heavy ion effects (needed for space applications), making this technology competitive with bulk BICMOS technology.";;;;;THOMSON CSF SEMICONDUCTEURS SPECIFIQUES;FR;"SGS THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS SA;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);GEC Marconi Electronic Devices Ltd;FRAUNHOFER INSTITUT FÜR SILICATFORSCHUNG;Deutsche Aerospace AG;NATIONAL MICROELECTRONICS RESEARCH CENTRE;University of Sheffield;SEXTANT AVIONIQUE SA;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE";"FR;UK;DE;IE";

Research has been carried out in order to specify the means for integrating people with visual, motor and speech disabilities into the multimedia communication network. Personal use of general telecommunication service was investigated and involved the following:
interaction with multimedia retrieval systems in connection with applications such as teleshopping and telebanking;
access to information services (newsletters);
access to electronic mail services.

The impact of integrated broadcast communications (IBC) services and applications on the possibilities for communication and access to information by people with special needs has been assessed. Multimedia services and terminals have been functionally described and a survey was made of available hardware and software for use in terminals. Investigations have covered:
man machine interface (MMI) aspects of people with special needs;
redundancy and transferability in IBC signals;
IBC provisions for different people with special needs (PSN) user groups;
models of interaction between the user, the terminal and the network;
performance characteristics in monomodal and multimodal PSN user interactions;
future technological solutions;

A framework for definition of specifications has been defined giving the only complete and general IBC terminal functional reference model (FRM) in the Research and development in Advanced Communications technologies in Europe programme (RACE).
The standard reference manual of specifications for terminal designers will give the data necessary to ensure accessibility, either directly or by modular adaptations, for all users of European IBC terminals. This will increase integration within professional and social environments, give access to culture and improve autonomy in private life.
Technical Approach  

The main emphasis is on the support to be given to personal use of general telecommunication services. The main functions to be guaranteed are:  

. interaction with multimedia retrieval systems in connection with such applications as eg tele-shopping and tele-banking  
. access to information services (eg newsletters)  
. access to electronic mail services  
. access to interpersonal communication.  

These will increase people's integration within professional and social environments, give access to culture and improve their autonomy in private life.  

The starting model is an integrated terminal with data channel(s), voice channel(s), and graphics/image/video channel(s), each exhibiting characteristics governed by available bandwidth.  These channels can be integrated to support the needs of particular users and special services; alternatively redundant representations of information can be introduced into the system, when a direct access through normal transactions is not possible.  

Key Issues  
Adequately catering for the needs of user groups, for whom the IBC could otherwise be expected to add to their handicap, relative to the norm of the population.  

Achievements  
Envisaged IBC services and applications have been analysed, and their impact assessed on the possibilities for communication and access to information by people with special needs.  Multimedia services and terminals have been functionally described, and a survey made of available hardware and software for use in terminals.  

Investigations have covered:

. social issues.  

A significant achievement has arisen from the work to define an IBC terminal functional model, as a framework for definition of specifications.  As far as can be determined, this is the only complete and general IBC terminal FRM in RACE, and as such as has been the foundation for CFS L340: Functional Reference Model for IBC Terminals.

The work undertaken has been addressing the problem of the management of large sets of high quality documents in complex organisational environments. A set of tools for the production (mainly) and management of those types of documents has been under development. The technical effort was put into the design and implementation of a global architecture as a suitable basis for development applications. The kernel of the system consists of a software engine that understands the semantical content of the conceptual document and generates a final document according to the layout model defined by the presentation scheme. Nevertheless, the scope of the study is the development of real life applications for specific environments, mainly banks, in order to validate the kernel of the system on the issues of portabililty, functionality and toolkit support.

The production of documents is the basic activity of almost all offices. In particular, there are domains, such as banks, in public administration and in legal practices, where:
the documents produced follow predefined patterns (they cannot be created freely, but have to follow precise rules);
a large amount of data may be included in a document, and often the same data are used in a variety of closely related documents.

Many documents of an official nature exhibit these features. For this relatively large class of applications, the tools currently available for document production are largely inadequate and creation of these documents is still largely unautomated.
The technical approach of the project was based on the assumption that the characteristics of a given class of documents can be modelled by schemas. These schemas describe the structure of the document class and define all the variants which can be included in documents. When a user selects a schema, a semantic filter captures the data to be included in the document and transforms them into concepts (eg, the datum Mr Smith is associated with the concept seller). The collection of all these concepts is called a conceptual document. A specialized engine executes the schmea, using the conceptual document to generate a composed document, where the proper variants have been selected.

The set of software tools for a document workstation (SUPERDOC) project succeeded in producing a set of software tools for the automated production of these documents. This technology is being exploited in real life applications.

2 marketing strategies are being followed: to use the tools in existing applications as an add on for doucment production, and to develop specific applications that embed the SUPERDOC tools.

At several sites of the alpine regions, including the Alps, the Jura and the Pyrenees, comparative and complementary investigations will be carried out in the 2 main research areas of the dynamic of alpine forest ecosystems and the multiple use of mixed wood and grasslands ecosystems. 

In order to investigate the mechanisms controlling the long term dynamic of forest ecosystems, distinction is made between past trends and future trends. 2 distinct levels of analysis are given priorities as regards the study of past trends: 
a landscape ecological approach trends to reconstruct the history of different landscapes, to identify critical stages and to lead to further methodological guidelines for a more dynamic interpretation of current alpine forest landscapes; 
and a second approach concentrates on environmental factors which are likely to affect the vitality and capacity of regeneration of tree populations. Seed production has been selected as an appropriate indicator for such constraints. The investigation of potential trends are conducted in 2 directions. Both will concentrate on the processes of natural regeneration, and related environmental factors: 
in open areas, in order to assess the role of natural site conditions and anthropogenic factors on the recolonization of abandoned slopes; 
and in well established forest ecosystems, study of the gaps, natural or artificial, in order to assess their role in stand generation, as well as the relationships between structure and stability. 

In the research into multiple use of mixed grass and woodlands ecosystems, 3 levels of analysis are used: 
the landscape ecological approach to identify the different patterns of mixed pasture forest landscape, with regard to animal utilization (wild or domestic ungulates); 
silvopastoral systems to define the practical conditions for a sustainable multiple land use on the basis of the analysis of different systems, including experimental treatments; 
and tree grass interactions by analysis of the different interactions (through microclimate, soil, water and nutrient budgets, etc) and their impacts on the main components (grasslands and underlayers, animals and trees).";;;;CSC;International Centre for Alpine Environments;FR;"Centre National du Machinisme Agricole, du Génie Rural, des Eaux et des Forêts (CEMAGREF);CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS;Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA);Istituto Sperimentale per l'Assestamento Forestale e per l'Alpicoltura;Nationalparkverwaltung Berchtesgaden;Parc Naturel Régional du Vercors;Università degli Studi di Firenze;LEOPOLD-FRANZENS-UNIVERSITAET INNSBRUCK;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA;Università degli Studi di Padova;Université de Savoie;Università degli Studi di Torino";"FR;ES;IT;DE;AT";

8632;2569;EWS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;European Workstation;01/12/1989;31/12/1990;;"Impressive developments in distributed systems indicate that in the 1990s workstations will play an even more crucial role than they do now in enhancing the productivity of engineers and scientists. At present the market for such products is dominated by US companies, and Japan shows growing interest in competing in this area. Europe lags significantly behind. The EuroWorkstation (EWS) project aims to provide a competitive European response by the early 1990s: the industrial partners within the EWS project are committed to bringing EWS machines to the market. 

EWS is based upon an open modular architecture. Modularity is provided at three different levels: shared memory, communication bus and local area networks. This hierarchy allows appropriate trade-offs to be made between cost and performance. Shared memory is used for high-performance communications such as, for example, numerical applications where scalar and vector processing interfere. A communication bus is used for more autonomous coprocessors, where special efforts are invested in message-based communication mechanisms. 

The EWS project proposes to introduce the LIW concept at the workstation level. This concept is an extension of the RISC principle, since it can increase the number of instructions per cycle. Moreover, such techniques are very much in use for microcode purposes in current supercomputers and accelerators (FPS, NUMERICS, etc). Performance gains can be achieved by two main independent measures: a reduction in cycle times in proportion to finer feature sizes, with associated lower gate delays; and special (parallel) architectures tailored to a relatively small range of applications.

RISC and possibly VLIW approaches limit the design effort involved in producing these custom architectures. If a modular workstation provides a standard coprocessor communication system (CCS), performance can easily be boosted by adding special coprocessor boards according to the needs of the user. All that is required from the coprocessor is adherence to the CCS standard; its internal architecture can be derived from and optimised for the application area. 

The operating system (OS) of the workstation needs to be distributed to allow uniform and efficient sharing of the specific resources provided by the specialised coprocessor boards. Since the OS which serves as a basis for the EWS is designed to support task distribution over a LAN, it needs to be especially optimised to take advantage of the closer coupling of the heterogeneous hardware components within the workstation provided by the system bus. The OS will therefore be based on a message-passing service (the CCS), taking advantage of the facilities provided by the hardware bus (Multibus II) and providing interprocess communication facilities for easy cooperation of user processes being executed on the various components of the workstation. The EWS workstation will comply with existing communication standards (OSI and INTERNET). File sharing, remote execution and printing, and access to other equipment and sites will be provided.";;;;;SIEMENS AG;DE;"CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL);GRUPO DE EMPRESAS APD;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;Bull SA;Chorus Systèmes SA;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;Gipsi SA;Brunel University;Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG)";"UK;ES;PT;FR;DE";
8626;2484;SPIRIT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;The Spirit Workstation;05/12/1988;04/12/1992;;"The SPIRIT workstation project aims to design and build a high-performance technical workstation to support computationally demanding activities in computer-aided engineering, image processing, graphical interaction, knowledge-based systems, modelling and simulation, and the development of advanced applications software. The industrial partners intend to market a commercial product based on the prototypes developed within the project, and expect to establish a position of dominance in the high-performance end of the European technical workstation market by the mid-1990s.
The SPIRIT workstation's key features are:
a wide range of processing powers, from using a multiprocessor architecture;
open hardware architecture (high speed bus (Futurebus\) with a shared memory system, and an interface to an industry standard input/output (I/O) bus);
provision of a UNIX environment complying with industry standards;
object oriented environment (Smalltalk-80 extended with support for multiprocessing, distributed working, and advanced interactive 3-dimensional graphics and C\\);
high performance, high quality 3-dimensional graphics, rendering 3 x 106 vectors per second and 300 k Gouraud shaded polygons per second, with Gouraud and Phong shading, antialiasing, texturing, ray tracing, and radiosity;
networking via DoD internet protocols (TCP/IP), with Ethernet and fibre distributed data interface (FDDI) as low-level protocols implemented in hardware;
and a high performance I/O subsystem with a disk array throughput of over 20 megabytes per second.

SPIRIT is a high performance technical workstation designed for advanced applications in engineering design, medical image processing and scientific visualisation. The SPIRIT workstation combines exceptional computing power using a multiprocessor architecture with high performance 3-dimensional real time, true colour graphics. The SPIRIT workstation is a tightly coupled multiprocessor design, communicating over a bus with a sustained bandwidth of over 100 MBytes per second. It provides 80-600 mixed integer programming units and 20-140 mega floating point operations, with data rates capable of transmitting realtime video and providing realtime 3-dimensional graphical interaction. The software base is an industry standard UNIX system, augmented with object oriented programming environments and artificial intelligence languages, all fully integrated. The system software is implemented with advanced software technology which includes a multithreaded, tightly coupled, heterogeneous operating system kernel. This support for heterogeneity is the key prerequisite to incorporate new processors as they appear. The SPIRIT workstation is equipped with standard networking facilities.
The workstation will use a small-scale multi-processor design, based around a central very-high-speed memory system and using data rates capable of transmitting real-time video or providing real-time 3-D graphic interaction. General-purpose processors (chosen early in the project from the leading industry-standard processors) will be used, as well as a high-performance AI processor. The software base will include an industry-standard Unix system, augmented with object-oriented programming environments and AI languages, particularly Prolog, all capable of integration with networking facilities. The system software will be implemented with state-of-the-art software technology which includes an operating system kernel suitable for multiprocessor and distributed working. 

To achieve the wide range of capabilities envisaged without causing unnecessary costs for applications with different technical requirements, the hardware architecture chosen is modular, with high performance in three particular areas: 2-D and 3-D graphics, AI languages, and image processing, each achieved with special-purpose hardware subsystems that could be omitted from any particular machine. On the other hand, sharing development and software costs means that the workstation as a whole will be cheaper to develop than many specialised machines directed at narrower market segments. 

The project is founded on the cooperation of industrial partners across national boundaries, bringing together four groups in four different countries, each contributing excellence in different areas of workstation design, image processing, system software, graphics hardware, and AI language hardware. 

A fundamental outcome of the SPIRIT workstation project will be the ability of European industry to achieve at least parity with non-European competition at the high-performance end of the workstation market. This will not only provide a good position for progressing to more advanced products in the later 1990s, but will also provide a base for supporting the migration of high-end technology to lower-cost machines throughout the decade.";;;;;Kontron Elektronik GmbH;DE;"British Aerospace Defence Ltd;ASSOCIATED COMPUTER EXPERTS;ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE DE LAUSANNE;UNIVERSITÄT TÜBINGEN;UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX;Gipsi SA;Telmat Informatique SA;Caption";"UK;NL;CH;DE;FR";

The combined analogue to digital integration (CANDI) project aims at the development of the main technologies and implementation techniques needed for the fabrication of complete analogue to digital (AD) systems on silicon, exploiting the specific advantages of both bipolar (high speed components, high driving capability and high precision analogue circuitry) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) (high integration density and low power consumption) transistors. The final objective is the full integration of technology, design and computer aided design (CAD) tools in the fabrication of prototype system components for major fields of application such as consumer electronics and telecommunications.
The project has 2 phases. The first phase has been competed. It led to the development of a common 1.2 micron technology starting from a 1.2 micron CMOS process, with 5 additional mask levels for the incorporation of the bipolar part. A layout cross compilation system has been developed which is used to translate layouts of cells, subcircuits or entire circuits implemented in a given technology into layouts of a different version of the same technology. This includes the possibility of converting layouts from a pure CMOS technolgoy into the CMOS part of a BICMOS technology. Geometrical and electrical relations between the 2 different technologies are taken into consideration in the translation.
A specific cell library database has been developed, containing all relevant data, which can be distributed on VAX computers.
The manufacturability of the process and the design capabilities have been proven through the fabrication of 3 demonstrators: a digital luminance and chrominance to analogue RGB (red green blue) components decoder for improved definition television (IDTV) applications; a mixed AD array, including a bipolar high frequency array and a BICMOS sea of gates array; and a 16-channel bit shuffler for broadband telecommunication multiplexing.
The sec ond phase of the project is leading to the development of a 0.8 micron process generation as well as to design techniques that will enable the realization of highly complex high performancecircuits. 2 technologies are being developed covering complementary market segments. A high speed version with 5 V supply voltage for both CMOS and bipolar, suitable for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), telecommunication and high definition television (HDTV) applications has been developed. A technology with high performance analogue capabilities has been developed where the supply voltage is 5 V for CMOS and 9 V for bipolar. This technology will address radio mobile, automotive, consumer electronic and telecommunication applications.

The Raster Image Processor (RIP) will consist of a board, which can be plugged into a PC (AT) or a PS/2 or compatible, with between 8 and 16 Mbyte of memory and using a modern CPU. It will provide several common page-description languages (PDLs), such as PostScript, together with outline-fonts as a common interpreter and a common font resource. EURORIP will be used as platform for standard PDLs and fonts in order to facilitate porting them to special raster image processors. It will directly drive a screen and a common laser-printer engine, and will be easily adaptable for special screens, laser or inkjet printer engines or typesetters, as it will handle coarse resolution (screens), low resolution (printers), and high resolution (typesetters) simultaneously. Adapting EURORIP for other hosts (such as mainframe computers) will be possible as well. 

EURORIP aims to produce the first RIP to provide several interpreter languages at once, to solve the font selection problem by providing a font server, to enable a grey-scale screen display as true WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), and to give colour enhancements to PDLs. The latter enhancement is needed for many applications in CAD, desktop publishing and office automation, but is not provided by existing solutions. 

Particular project objectives are to: 

- use a high-performance CPU, and so work with a very new and powerful processor 
- generate grey-scale signals for display on colour screens (true WYSIWYG and proofing without paper) 
- provide a 'Font Bakery' with the best international layout for Roman fonts 
- provide a 'Type Finder' to solve the naming problem for fonts in a pragmatic way 
- provide a large library of outline fonts to solve the problem of a missing font at an arbitrary location 
- provide a large number of format conversions 
- add colour enhancements to PostScript

The validity of the tools to be developed will be tested through demonstration prototypes of specific applications.

The system includes an acquisition tool, NKAT (Normative Knowledge Acquisition Tool), which is intended to support a knowledge engineer in the formalisation of normative texts. The approach to be taken in developing this component will include linguistic analysis on selected portions of the text and topic identifications, aiming at a text formalisation suitable for the inference engine; the requirements of retrieval systems based on such a formalisation will also be considered. 

A Knowledge Representation Language (KRL) will be defined based on the specific requirements of the normative fields. In particular, one of the latest approaches to KRL (eg hybrid systems) will be taken as a basis and augmented with normative elements resulting from an analysis of normative texts. 

The applications are expert systems (a normative expert system for French and Italian) in the normative area; these will produce legal advice and suggestions when fed with specific cases. Starting from the specification of a 'case', NINFE will deduce the relevant consequences of a set of formalised norms, with these norms extracted from the normative texts using NKAT. Furthermore, a Text Retrieval study on System (TRS) will be undertaken in order to demonstrate that NKAT is also suitable for applications different from expert systems. 

The major result of the project should come from NKAT, namely the provision of a tool which will significantly help the task of engineering the knowledge of normative texts. Given the high cost of this task, and even though a high level of involvement by a human expert will still be required, this tool will represent a major advance in the development of knowledge-based applications, as well as applications of text retrieval, in the normative field. 

The demand for knowledge-based applications in the normative field has been growing strongly over the past few years, and most partners in the consortium will exploit the outcomes of the project in this area. On the other hand, the reuse of the results of the project (in particular, NKAT) in other fields apart from the normative one is envisaged by some of the partners.";;;;;Società Generale d'Informatica SpA;IT;"Step Informatique;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR);INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;Tecsiel SpA;AXON-INST.DE INFORM.NORMATIVA AVANCADA;HELLASLEX;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)";"FR;IT;PT;EL";

The results of irrigation research must be applied not only at farm level but also cooperatively at a local/regional level.  The resulting actions must be coordinated continuously if the water resource is to be managed efficiently and optimally.  To do this, the area and its component features (soil types, climate, topography, water resources, farm types, crop distribution, etc.) must be represented in such a way as to permit the prediction of the results of the interactions of those features on each other.  The best way to do this is to model the system and to define the interactions mathematically using existing research results.  This project will do this and will subsequently develop a computer system which will permit agricultural advisers, technicians, and farmers to optimize the use of irrigation water. 
Work is underway to construct a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation management at the farm level and at consecutive local and regional levels. The main components of the software system include a user interface, knowledge processor, simulation models and data processor. The user interface provides a user friendly means of communication of input parameters and decision support output at the end of the analysis. The knowledge processor translates the user's requirements into a simulation problem and contains a set of user specific rules for the translation of simulation models consists of a set of modules or procedures which are used for calculating water balances, crop growth and regional water requirements. The data processor stores, manages and processes all the required data. It contains a geographical entities and GIS routines for the processing of regional parameters, together with other necessary data.

Major blocks of the DSS have been identified, described and discussed. A first prototype has been developed for demonstration purposes, which contains a number of elements. One of these is a databasecontaining soil, weather and crop input data for the simulation models and regional information. Simulation models for the assessment of crop water requirements have been remodelled for the DSS. Geographical information has been loaded to a GIS and a user friendly interface has been developed.
The project addresses a research problem which is not as well developed in the Southern Community as it is in the North of the Community.  The project will relay heavily on the sparse but very relevant know-how and experience in the Southern Countries as well as on the transfer of this technology from North to South by adapting and developing it for the different conditions.  

The result of these efforts will be a Decision Support System for (supplementary) irrigation management at farmers and regional level, available immediately after project completion.  

Main components of this software system include :  

- simulation models for the determination of crop- water requirement taking into account climatic conditions and soil-water movement,  
- a tool to convert crop-water requirements into irrigation demands,  
- a rule based system that converts simulation results in user-defined information (i.e. advice on timing and amount of irrigation),  
- an extended 'GIS' for the management and processing of required input data and simulation results.";;;;;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI TRENTO;IT;"ROTHAMSTED RESEARCH LIMITED;ISTITUTO AGRONOMICO MEDITERRANEO;CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS;Instituto Superior de Agronomia;HITEC MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTER APPLICATION SA;THE WINAND STARING CENTRE;Bonifica SpA Consulting Engineers";"UK;IT;ES;PT;EL;NL";

The project was split into 3 projects, one of which was GENESIS II.
During the project Genesis, a number of benchmark programs were developed to evaluate the performance of the German SUPRENUM distributed memory (DM) computer compared to other parallel computers (including multiple vector and shared memory architectures). The refinement of this benchmark suite to assist in the SUPRENUM evaluation has been assessed. Several new benchmarks were added and extensive changes were made to several other benchmarks, such as the fast Fourier transform routines. In the rush to obtain the highest possible performance on SUPRENUM, some standards were sacrificed. For instance, not everybenchmark has a corresponding Fortran-77 single node baseline code written for it. Sometimes the sequential code was lacking, and sometimes extensive use of Fortran-90 extensions was made. One of the major activities of this project has been the filling in of many of these holes.

The GENESIS project had the ambitious aim of establishingEuropean leadership in the field of high performance parallel systems for numerical applications. The project was split into 3 projects, 1 of which was GENESIS II. Work in GENESIS II concentrated on software environments for high performance numerical computing on distributed memory architectures. Portable programming models and user friendly programming environment are key issues for high performance computing and will broaden the acceptance of large parallel distributed memory systems. In addition, the project included a small but important architectural task concerned with advanced interconnection components. In the long term, only the combination of functionalities for user requirements, user programming model, low level system software support for communication and interconnection components will guarantee highly efficient parallel user program execution. The main results of GENESIS II were:
the development of advanced software environment for highly parallel systems;
the development of a base of commercially relevant application packages and basic libraries;
realization of an implementation of a target testbed (GENESIS-P) as proposed in project 2447, GENESIS;
facilitation of the migration of applications from existing systems and to ensure portability of new implementations;
reflection of current and emerging standards, and participation in corresponding actions.

develop a base of commercially relevant application packages and basic libraries 
realise an implementation of a target testbed which led to the CS-2 machine 
facilitate migration of existing applications and ensure portability of new implementations 
reflect current and emerging standards, and to participate in corresponding actions. 

Portability became a major issue of the project and the PARMACS (GMD/Argonne Portability Macro Library) was chosen as the common central programming model. A complete programming environment supports the development of PARMACS programs. A large set of software components is already in place, and will provide direct support for new architectures based on the advanced interconnection technology.

The project aims to make the following improvements in the domain of feed and servo drives: 

- Accuracy and resolution: the ability of the control system to achieve smooth, accurate motion in multiple axes, in spite of major detrimental effects such as friction and load disturbances, is an important aim. IDRIS will develop drives which can better cope with such problems over a wider range of operating conditions. 
- Increased speed range: IDRIS is aiming towards an order of magnitude improvement at the lower end. 
- Flexibility: the trend in machine-tool design is towards multi-purpose machines, requiring axes to be driven in different ways at different times. IDRIS drives will be able to handle a wider range of operating conditions. 
- Reliability and fault handling: the amounts of power being handled by machine tool drives makes it important that the control system is able to detect and diagnose faults rapidly. IDRIS aims to extend the distribution and level of diagnostics information. 
- Improved power usage, involving the more efficient and cleaner use of the electrical power supplied: IDRIS will develop a regenerative power supply which will draw from and put power back to the mains as necessary while maintaining a near-unity power factor. This will also result in cooler, quieter operation of the drives. 

A main theme within IDRIS is the extension of real-time digital control technology from the CNC level through to the current control level, using digital communications to link the various levels. In doing so, the control structure becomes much more open, accessible and flexible, leading to the opportunity to improve drive performance through more intelligent control, with control and decision processes distributed across levels for the best effect. This work involves the development of a modular, open architecture with standard interfaces, allowing easy optimisation of drive systems for varying requirements. 

The use of simulation is a key feature of the IDRIS approach, featuring the development of specialised easy-to-use simulation software that can be used to test control strategies and their effect on performance. 

In order to provide a realistic test-bed which will be able to demonstrate and measure the benefits of the IDRIS prototypes, the project will build a machine designed specially for this purpose. This test-bed demonstrator will be complemented by visual aids intended to promote awareness of the results of the project. 

The demonstrators will feature a System Management Station designed to allow development, testing or commissioning engineers to view the behaviour of the system and to access the various control parameters for tuning and optimisation purposes. 

A number of benefits to the end-user will be demonstrated by the end of the project, such as the implementation of friction compensation techniques to overcome, for example, quadrant transition errors during circular interpolation, and the ability to change speed controller settings in real time to demonstrate the handling of known load-shock disturbances.";;;;;MARI Applied Technologies Ltd;UK;"UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;Robert Bosch GmbH;NADA Consulting Group";"UK;DE";

The project investigates the determining factors for leaching under controlled conditions in open top chambers. In previous experiments, different foliar leaching rates under winter and summer conditions were found. To confirm these results the investigations will be prolonged for a further 21 month period. In order to allow a more detailed interpretation, investigations into stemflow and nitrogen allocation using nitrogen-15 as a tracer are included. 

The influence of ambient air pollutants on physiological and biochemical parameters will be investigated with emphasis put on the vegetation period. The relationships between increased leaching, if any, and long term effects on plant metabolism will be investigated. The experiments screen metabolic parameters which are known to be sensitive. Under low air pollutant concentrations found at the remote, clean air Edelmannshof site, the response of metabolic parameters is not as obvious as in laboratory experiments. Furthermore, they are covered by natural noise. Considered separately, the observed parameters are probably not specific in their reactions to air pollutants, their response may also be triggered by other influences. Combining these parameters, more specific responses of plant metabolism to different stress factors are expected to be obtained. 

Continuous measurements of immission and weather data will be performed. Dry and wet deposition will be sampled above the canopy at the top of a 7 m high tower including measurements of air humidity, temperature, PAR and potential evaporation. The results will be analysed for weekly mean values. Precipitation will be sampled weekly above the canopy and below the crown of each tree in the chambers. Soil temperature is controlled by sensors and tensiometers and sucking soil lysimeters are installed. 

Samples of 0 year and one year old needles are taken 4 times a year. Each research group uses the identical sample for the analysis of different parameters. The samples will be taken from fully light exposed twigs of the fourth to sixth whorl. Each needle year will be analysed separately. The sampling periods are: before bud break, after bud break, and in the summer and autumn. During extreme immission periods of ozone or sulphur dioxide, additional sampling is planned. In addition, the daily variation of photosynthesis and of enzyme activities and metabolites of carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism will be measured 4 times a year.

Existing models of crop production in the different participating countries have been examined, translated and adapted to enable the DSS to be built up. For new models, a special internal structure has been agreed for easier translation and adaptation. Several models and computer programs have been translated into English and are being used by other participants in the project. Adaptation of models and programs for use under different conditions is proving difficult since weather data and other parameters have to be collected in the same manner as in the country of the program author.
Starting with the translation, adaptation and testing for EC use of crop production information models in Europe a methodology for moving from an information model to a DSS will be built up.  Next step is the development of a global information model for arable farms using the Information Engineering Methodology and the Workbench tool.  Existing models in the different participating countries can be made accessible and integrated with each other.  

The development of a testing methodology for the evaluation of prototype DSS will be based on a review of existing methodology and the needs of the project. Existing and new prototype DSS for wheat and maize will be tested for use under field conditions.  

The models for variety choice in wheat as well as for weed control and fertilization will be completed as computer models.  Those models will be combined to one wheat DSS (Decision Support System).  Also aphid and fungicide control will be part of the model.  One special model for variety choice will be built up for maize.

As many of the tools employed are frequently used in all sorts of M&D, and as most of these systems have common structural characteristics, this conventional approach leads to an enormously wasteful duplication of effort in design, testing and implementation. 

The TOPMUSS project aims to relieve M&D developers of the need to keep re-inventing the wheel. The goal of TOPMUSS is to design and create an applications-specific high level CASE (computer-aided software engineering) development system for designing and testing specific applications. 
The goal of the project was to design and create an applications specific high level computer aided software engineering (CASE) development system for designing and testingspecific applications. The monitoring and diagnosis (M and D) development system consists of:
the Information Description Package for the acquisition of application specific knowledge;
a library of tools for signal and information processing, including knowledge about tool properties;
a program (expert supervisor) that uses the available knowledge to guide tool selection;
a system for testing configured run time M and D systems;
a facility for producing target run time M and D systems.

Several uses for the toolbox are as follows:
using just the Information Description Package module to acquire, analyse and structure knowledge about an available but yet unused process;
acquiring the knowledge once (using the remainder of the toolbox to quickly produce series of target M and D systems for similar machines or plants to be delivered turn key including M and D. Using the prototyping facilities to scrutinize and improve complex M and D systems, whether running already or just planned (this does not necessarily involve the production of a target system);
using it for basic research on methods, tools and algorithms for M and D;
using it for subsequent validation of already running M and D systems produced conventionally;
using it for simulation of plants.
The M&D development system will consist of the following main building-blocks: 

- the 'Information Description Package' for the acquisition of application-specific knowledge 
- a library of tools for signal and information processing, including knowledge about tool properties 
- a library and knowledge administrator 
- a system for testing functionality and MMI of configured run-time M&D systems

17027;A 1020 (8417);VALIDATA;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Validated Data Bank and Dissemination for Prescribers;;;;"There is a gap between the information available on the risk/benefit ratio and the cost/effectiveness of many medical technologies and the use that is made of this information by the doctors. 
There are several reasons for this ; one being that pertinent information does not reach the prescribers or is lost within the noise. 
We propose to use modern technology, data banks, meta-analysis techniques, computer networks and doctor-friendly terminals to provide the European prescribers with validated information on medical technologies (i.e. drugs, other therapies, strategies for cure, prevention and diagnosis) based on pertinent data.
Modern information technology (in the form of data banks), metaanalysis techniques, computer networks and user friendly workstations) has been applied to the problem of supplying prescribers with validated information on drugs, nonpharmacological therapies and strategies for care, prevention and diagnosis. Definitions, basic concepts, information fluxes and procedures for handling the information were set up. Prototypes of procedures and tools were built and tested. 
The project considered: 
data collection; 
validation processes; 
message shaping processes; 
dissemination. The best approach for information collection seemed to be a register approach based on voluntary notification. A first version of a software package for metaanalysis and data presentation has been produced. This software incorporates several techniques and a large array of graphical displays are available for the presentation of results. The ideal medical interface could not be identified from a review of the literature so a trial and error approach was taken. Hypertext was found to meet the demands. Options had to be available to provide an overview of validated information and check for the relevance of patient oriented information. The first prototype of the message data bank was presented to a panel of general practitioners. Compact disc read only memory technology appeared to be the most relevant medium to support the service. The requirements for a terminal and procedures in the physician's office have been identified. The pilot phase has achieved its main goals to elaborate the conceptual framework of a European system for transferring validated information to the prescriber; to identify the technical solutions that would best fit with both the objectives and the psychosociological and economic constraints; to demonstrate both the feasibility and the acceptability of the concept by the doctors.
In order to establish these objectives several phases must be established : 
1. an operational core system which comprises : a data collection process, a pertinent information selection process, a validation process, message shaping process and a dissemination procedure ; 
2. an administrative structure for future operations ; 
3. an evaluation procedures. 
The proposal is limited in the first phase to an evaluation of the difficulties that would be encountered in setting up such an approach and to the elaboration of potentially effective solutions. 
The partners will not only have to consider technical problems but functional problems as well.

Several concepts for the coupling of numerical models for the simulation of complete ecosystem scenarios of the Wadden Sea have been planned. The necessary software has been realized and to some extent also validated. Submodels for the atmosphere, the sea to atmosphere interface and the various transport processes in the water column as well as numerical models for the biological and chemical processes have been modified to run interactively, exchanging their information within appropriate time steps, instead of being subjected to fixed boundary conditions. In previous approaches those boundary conditions were externally prescribed, whereas in nature they are influenced and modified by the simulated submodel processes. Progress was made in modelling biological and chemical processes and coupling them to other processes of ocean and atmosphere. Progress was also achieved in modelling transport of matter and in investigation of nearshore air to sea interaction processes.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
An interacting chain of models will be set up for the Wadden Sea, describing atmospheric oceanographic processes, ocean waves, sediment transport and ecological processes.  In all the mentioned individual disciplines there are still some research deficiencies especially within the area of influencing each other.  Especially the influence of ecological processes on the physical properties has to be investigated.  The oceanographic models will be close to those used by the national weather centres.  Several sediment transport models will be compared with available data since there is not much experience with the quality of sediment models.

EUROTRIP is producing a demonstration trip planning system installed as part of a field test. EUROTRIP will be based upon a detailed specification for a Europe wide system. Evaluation of the demonstration system will lead to recommendations regarding the installation of a European system. 

EUROTRIP is providing a detailed specification for the introduction of a European trip planning system. This will incorporate details of the software, hardware, data and infrastructure required for such a system. The report will recommend how such a system could be developed and discuss the benefits that will be obtained. 

This project is concerned primarily with information provided to the user prior to a journey being made. Access to information will be possible during a journey using static or mobile access facilities. This information will be complementary to that produced by dynamic information systems.

16924;V1054;ASTERIX;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;System and Scenario Simulation for Testing RTI Systems;;;;"The basic objective of the project is to build up a traffic simulation system suitable for testing RTI systems in large urban areas.
The main aim of the research was to build up a traffic simulation system suitable for testing a selected set of road transport informatics (RTI) systems in large urban areas. The simulation software developed will be able to estimate quantitative effects and make predictions of the impact of RTI systems including route guidance, advanced control systems governing traffic lights, variable message signs, tidal flow systems, artificial intelligence (AI) systems for traffic control, etc.

From the conceptual structure of the proposed system the work has been organised logically into 3 levels:
the development, integration and testing of the system shell (a transportation network database, a set of graphic tools and a set of user interfaces interfacing the scenario into which the RTI system will be simulated);
the development, integration and testing of software interfaces linking the simulation systems to the system shell;
development of improvements and new modelling capabilities in the simulation system components to deal with the simulation of RTI systems.

A prototype working system has been completed.
The new simulation software will be able to estimate the quantitative effects, and make predictions of, the impact of the introduction of RTI systems (such as route guidance, advanced control systems governing traffic lights, variable message signs, tidal flow systems, artificial intelligence systems etc). 
The new simulation system will be based on various existing macroscopic type traffic models, and since none of the existing models has been designed to simulate traffic behaviour under RTI conditions, various improvements and extensions on various existing models will need to be developed and tested in order to fill this gap. 
The various tasks of the project will include the following: 
a) State of the art survey of existing simulation systems for large urban areas (including an investigation of their adequacy for modelling the effects of the introduction of RTI systems and of any changes that would be required), 
b) Definition of the requirements for the incorporation of RTI systems in traffic simulation models, 
c) Implementation of extensions and changes to existing traffic simulation systems in order to deal with RTI introduction requirements. Such extensions and changes might include: 
- alternative assignment strategies, 
- modelling the variability of traffic flows, 
- dealing with guided and unguided vehicles, 
- handling of multiple vehicle types or conditions, 
- dealing with driver information systems, 
- provision of linkage between signal control and route guidance, 
- pollution and fuel consumption sub-models, 
- modelling car-park choice with and without information systems. 
d) Improvements in the components of simulation systems such as: 
- modelling congestion, 
- network decomposition/network aggregation assignment, 
- non symmetric assignment capability, 
- non equilibrium modelling, 
- time dependent assignment. 
e) Integration of microscopic concepts into the macroscopic system of models described above and checking the consistency of such integration. 
f) Systems testing and integration, calibration, validation and documentation. 
g) Implementation of software environment components such as user/system interfaces, graphic tools, etc. 
The project overlaps with two other projects - V1046 FRIDA and V1052 ICARUS - which are also partly working on DRIVE Workplan tasks T202 and T205. Effective coordination and exchange of data and results amongst the three projects should be attempted through the concertation meetings and other forms of contacts.

16950;V1023;EUROTOPP;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;European Transport Planning Process;;;;"The specification of a new type of transport demand model, which would be dynamic and information sensitive has been defined and a first working prototype has been produced.
The general approach developed was a synthesis of 3 promising streams of new modelling research. These were microsimulation (which allows detailed treatment of the adaptation of behaviour at the individual level), activity based analysis (which allows travel to be considered in the context of household activity requirements, which evolve over time) and macroscopic techniques (which allow functional treatment of empirical relationships which may not yet be fully understood at the individual level). The specification was constructed around the idea of a simulated individual, living in a simulated household defined by life style and life cycle position, which evolves over time in accordance with demographic, economic, social and physical processes. There is a pattern of planned activities and in order to carry them out decisions are necessary concerning their location, timing, methods of travel and routes. When the individual sets out to realise the plan, there is a process of choice, which takes account of conflicts and opportunities due to changing circumstances, external information or earlier decisions (including wrong decisions which might have caused delay or failure to carry out certain activities). There is a learning process which enables plans, or the methods of travel used, etc, to be changed day by day or week by week. That experience is also accumulated and influences responses to longer term choices. This approach was embodied in an idealised version of the model.
A prototype version of the model has been implemented in C\\ under the X-window system using the OSF/MOTIF window manager, running on UNIX platforms. Some but not all of the fundamental algorithms have been tested using travel survey data from France, and experimental choice data from the Netherlands. In addition, a pilot version of the model was used for 2 case studies, one on the effects of pretrip information and the other on the effects of urban road pricing, using data from Dutch and German applications.
A prototype was made available on 08/25/92
To take RTI effects into account for traffic forecasting and transport planning tools, the DRIVE workplan suggests the general idea of building macroscopic relationships from microscopic behaviour rules. The new tools should restore the image of the existing transport planning process; they will consist of a series of steps and models developed with reference to the traditional trip generation, modal choice and route choice process of the 'partially' informed traveller. 
Even if the EUROTOPP project (which is aiming at major technical and intellectual innovation in the field) is aware of the possibility that in some cases systems have synergistic rules of operation which do not derive simply from individual behaviour, they will implement the suggested approach in two ways. The analytical form of the mathematical functions used will have a sound statistical basis in behavioural theory. When the behavioural laws are so complex that the mathematical and statistical relationships are not fully defined, the project will use some of the techniques of `simulation' modelling. 
The project will take the best elements from existing approaches in the light of the properties that the final model must have, namely it must: 
- be comprehensive 
- be sensitive to traffic policy and RTI developments 
- have the ability to deal with the whole network in detail or a general system in lesser detail 
- have a rigourous statistical and mathematical basis 
- allow dynamic formulation with an explicit timescale 
- be consistent with research on travel behaviour 
- retain flexibility for later development. 
As part of the project's work the new planning approach will be incorporated in system specifications suitable for software implementation. In order to test the scope, characteristics and data requirements of a transport planning tool based on dynamic methods, an existing microscopic simulation model will be developed further. This pilot model will be tested in two case studies relating both to urban and inter-urban situations. The case studies will include public transport with special reference to its treatment of traveller information. 
Four time frames will be used to structuring the modelling effort: long term, medium term, daily and trip. The results from lower levels will be incorporated into the decision mechanisms of the higher levels and alternatively the choices at higher levels should serve as constraints at the lower level (dynamic modelling). 
Four stringent tests of validity will be carried out, namely 
- accuracy of representation of base data 
- accuracy in reproduction of known elasticities 
- ability to forecast a known outcome 
- internal consistency and consistency with completed fundamental research. 
Liaison with those working on other DRIVE tasks in the '200' series is particularly important.

Existing procedures for standardization on semantical aspects in medicine will be surveyed in different European countries, Infoterm and WHO. Some standardization examples on medical concepts will be carried out and proposals will be developed for standardization activities on semantics in the future, which can be seen as proposals for the AIM main phase. 

A standardization body should be built on the principle of the benefit of the interested parties and the voluntary use of standards. In contracts, rules and laws can be referred to these standards. In such a way a standard can become obligatory for the parties of a contract or the people to whom the rules and laws apply. Standards developed in cooperation between interested parties should be easily accessible. 
Within the short term period of the AIM Exploratory Action standardization procedures will be proposed and the international framework will be set up. Suggestions for the set up of standardization organizations on the national levels will be given. Some existing classifications will be collected and compared (i.e. primary health care, medical procedures, drugs).

16937;V1039;ATTAIN;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Applicability in Transport and Traffic of Artificial Intelligence;;;;"The main goals of the project are: 
- The identification of potential areas in traffic engineering to which AI may be beneficially applied; 
- To give the traffic engineer a helpful guide which includes criteria and characteristics of AI methods and techniques in non-specialist language; 
- To supply useful information to other DRIVE tasks dealing with the possible application of AI methods in road traffic engineering and also to maintain a close cooperation between the more application oriented projects within DRIVE such as 6205 and 6525.
The objectives of the project are the identification of potential areas in traffic engineering to which artificial intelligence (AI) may be beneficially applied and to give the traffic engineer a helpful guide which includes criteria and characteristics of AI methods and techniques in a common language. These methods will be assessed with respect to traffic engineering feasibility.
Current traffic engineering applications have to deal with incomplete, inconsistent uncertain and rapidly changing data. The still increasing traffic load aggravates the above mentioned situation and requires very complex traffic control systems.
Artificial intelligence research aims to a new way of representation and handling of fuzzy and symbolic knowledge which seems to be more convenient to humans. Up to now the information exchange between traffic engineers and AI researchers was insufficient due to the discrepancy of the description techniques of both domains. An open framework for interdisciplinary cooperation should push along the integrated application of AI methods and techniques in traffic engineering problem areas as follows: flexible control structures with the capability to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances, improvement of the reliability and consistency of traffic data, suitable man machine interfaces for better knowledge acquisition, better classification and prediction of relevant traffic events, correlations between traffic patterns and causes and behaviour oriented simulation of individual driver decisions.

Future systems in traffic control, traffic information management, transportation planning, fleet management and traffic safety will be more and more computer based to meet the requirements for speed, comfort and safety. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) based software approaches to traffic engineering (TE) problems which can be solved only inadequately by conventional methods or which have had to be excluded previously from computerization. The research set out to analyse the requirements which should be present in considered traffic problem areas to ensure a beneficial application of artificial intelligence to enhance conventional techniques or to tackle completely new domains. A decision tree has been set up which leads to the identification of classes of AI applications which are similar or analogous to a given TE problem. This classification was derived from generic problems to which AI is typically applied and of which practical experienced from related areas is available. Together with this, a concise set of criteria and prerequisites concerning solution space, computational complexity, uncertainty of input parameters, presence of heuristics etc, was collected to support the traffic engineer in identifying problems which are suitable for applying AI. A major result is the proposal of several protoypical projects which exhibit the best chances in proving artificial intelligence as a powerful tool for solving current open questions or for enhancing inadequately realized existing systems.
Road traffic engineers will work closely together with AI experts to build up a common base of knowledge and understanding. This will be necessary for cooperation not only in this project but in all DRIVE tasks dealing with the application of Artificial Intelligence.

16923;V1053;MODEM;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Modelling of Emission and Consumption in Urban Areas;;;;"In order to design and implement control strategies that will minimize the environmental impact of traffic, it is necessary to understand the complex relationships between the macroscopic traffic conditions (such as vehicle density, average speed, length of queues), the microscopic vehicle conditions and the emissions and consumption rates of the vehicles. 
Measurements will be made of all three types of parameters, in order to develop mathematical models of urban emissions and consumption.
The main aim of the research, titled project MODEM, was to model exhaust and noise emissions, and fuel consumption, taking into account temperature, acceleration and other data, in order to predict environmental changes resulting from the installation of different traffic management systems including road transport informatics (RTI).

Research focused on the following issues:
a set of represent driving in urban areas;
a model of emission and consumption from emission factors;
link between emission and general indicators of traffic;
the long term evaluations of changes in RTI, vehicles and regulations.

Data collection from driving behaviour has been carried out using 59 cars in 3 countries (73000 km travelled with measurements taken every second). The literature review on noise, exhaust emissions and fuel consumption has also been completed. The noise emission model was completed as an acoustic simulation model.
The research programme will comprise three major stages. 
Firstly, a sample of vehicles will be instrumented to measure their operating conditions in urban areas. Measurements will be obtained for six connurbations in three European countries and for a wide variety of weather conditions. Driving cycles will be developed that represent the observed urban driving patterns. 
Secondly, laboratory tests will be carried out using chassis dynamometer installations on a sample of vehicles. Mathematical functions between exhaust and noise emission rates and the driving cycles will be assessed for a wide range of current and future vehicles types (long term). 
At the third stage, and in order to validate the functions derived from the two above stages, a full scale test will be held in the traffic experimental areas of Toulouse using vehicles instrumented to measure both operating characteristics and emission rates. The test will be carried out both before and after any change in the traffic control system. The data recorded from the loop detectors will be analysed in conjunction with the data from the instrumented vehicles to determine the traffic parameters that are best correlated with the microscopic vehicle data used in the emission and consumption model.

8988;5084;CTA-SME;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Concerted Technology Access for Small and Medium-Size Enterprises;;;;"CTA-SME is a one-year pilot action to try out ways of improving the awareness and take-up of microelectronics technologies by small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). It is intended to provide a forum through which relevant activities at Community and national level can communicate, exchange information and address common problems. 
In addition to convening workshops and setting up training activities, the pilot phase will prepare (in collaboration with the relevant member-state programmes) 'technology transfer packages' that contain information covering the market analysis, economic assessment, design and fabrication of ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). Initially drawing on the results of existing ESPRIT microelectronics projects, these 'packages' will be made available to SMEs and national SME service centres throug hout the European Community. 
If the pilot phase, after independent evaluation, is found to have been successful, the Commission will propose the extension of the action with the aim of reaching a large number of the approximately 25,000 European SMEs that could (as recent surveys indicate) incorporate ASICs and other microelectronics components into their products and so gain a competitive advantage in the global information technology market. 
ASICs are being used in an ever-widening range of products, ranging from aeroplanes to automobiles, toys to telephones, and word-processors to washing-machines. Almost every sector of manufacturing industry can benefit from the application of ASIC technology, as it permits manufacturers to add more functions to their products, so that systems and equipment can achieve higher performances and be made more versatile and easier to use. As well as simplifying product design and cutting manufacturing, assemblyand subsequent maintenance times, ASIC technology helps reduce the number of components and material costs while increasing reliability. All this improves the profit-margins and competitive position of the companies concerned. 
SMEs, with their capacity for quick and timely innovation, are playing a crucial role in maintaining the competitiveness of Europe's IT industry. Their faster reactions to changing market conditions and willingness to take risks accelerates the development of new types of products and the exploitation of leading-edge technologies. But most of the estimated 25,000 SMEs that could make good use of ASICs, recent surveys show, have either a limited capacity to make use of ASIC technology or little or no awareness of its potential for their business - and those that already use ASICs would benefit from expert evaluation of the pros and cons of using different approaches in any particular application.

The initial phase, over 2 years, will make it possible to identify the specific contributions from these technologies for the PME, as well as the barriers hindering their development and to define the specifications to experiment with an adapted approach on an array of typical PMEs. 

The selected research topics are as follows: methodology of needs diagnosis, equipment accessible products and their adaptation, the integration of educational technologies within corporate culture, the supporting or slowing contributions from external training personnel, the supporting or slowing contributions of the institutional environment, the communication strategy for the promotion of educational technologies with the PMEs. 

The second phase, over 3 years, and further defined from the results of the initial phase, will bear on experimenting recommendations and will lead, after assessing the results, to a synthesis of the proposal in order to make the educational technologies accessible to the PMEs.";;;;;Chambre Regionale de Commerce et d'Industrie des Pays de la Loire (CRCI);FR;"UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI GENOVA;FRANCE TELECOM;JUTLAND TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE;Scienter - Centro di Ricerche e Servizi Avanzati per la Formazione;MPO;INTERFORMATION PAYS DE LA LOIRE;CONS.

16919;V1058;CROW;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Condition of Road and Weather Monitoring System;;;;"There is a need for improved monitoring of road and meteorological conditions so that drivers may be warned of hazardous conditions and for traffic management purposes. 
Three different aspects concerning road condition and weather monitoring are considered in this project: 
- the surface condition of the road (loss of friction),  
- crosswinds,  
- visibility.
Systems have been developed to assist in reducing traffic accidents due to bad weather. More precisely, work has been carried out to develop a system architecture and to improve data acquisition techniques, for an integrated road and weather monitoring system, and to demonstrate its benefits for traffic control and management. The main elements include forecast methods, new sensors for road condition and fog monitoring, a new prototype monitoring system, and several data acquisition and data condensation algorithms including risk assessment.
More specifically, these elements are:
a technique to predict the onset of aquaplaning based on extrapolation of radar imagery;
a knowledge based system to provide fog warnings;
prototype microwave, infrared and laser based sensing systems for monitoring the condition of road surfaces;
an improved integrating nephelometer to assess road visibility;
a CROW road weather control centre, denoted as the CCC;
an algorithm to define safe traffic levels in bad weather conditions, based on road, weather and traffic data.
A prototype was made available on 25/08/92
For each of the subjects, general requirements and criteria for monitoring will be determined. Different types of sensor will be studied and prototypes built. Based on the performance of these prototypes, as well as the preliminary investigations, conclusions will be drawn and recommendations for traffic management made. 
Special attention will be paid to both traffic engineer and meteorological aspects. Moreover, communication between vehicle and road side will be taken into account.

EUCREX have been defined to clarify the crucial role of clouds in climate processes. Particular attention is payed to cirrus clouds, which are increasing the greenhouse effect of the earth's atmosphere. 
The work is primarily based on analyses of satellite data. Several small experimental campaigns are planned but major efforts are made to model the global climate with respect to its sensitivity to cloud properties and to model cloud processes. The location of the campaigns are not yet fixed; the first one is foreseen for fall 1991 and should cover essentially the Alpine Region. Several aircraft are participating. Another one covers Scotland.

16969;V1002;SMILER;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Short Range Microwave Links: Present and Future;;;;"The main objectives of this project were the survey of, and recommendations on, all currently envisaged microwave applications in road transport informatics (RTI). This will facilitate the decision making process of how and where microwave techniques may be deployed in the integrated road transport environment (IRTE). Where applicable these aims will be reinforced by means of SMILER contributions to the areas of standardisation and frequency allocation.
Initially the project has surveyed the state of the art including technical aspects, research and development efforts in the field and identified functional requirements. The further objectives of this project were then to make a comparative evaluation of 3 existing microwave technologies in the 2.5 and 9.9 GHz bands for short range communications between roadside equipment and vehicles, to compare these technologies with alternative link technologies such as cable systems, infrared links, to attempt to define more clearly the application fields and requirements for medium range (100 to 300 m) devices for use in applications such as anticollision systems or for vehicle to vehicle communications, to study the feasibility of a low cost radar front end using a planar quasioptical design, and to evaluate it by means of a laboratory prototype, to evaluate the suitability of the millimetric band (60 GHz region) for vehicle to vehicle communication links, in a typical road environment and to study the theory and feasibility of a unified link able to fulfil the requirements of road to vehicle and vehicle to vehicle communication, working in the 60 Ghz region.

The objective of the research was to study the feasibility of a low cost radar front end for anticollision (AC) purposes. The main function of the AC radar is to assist drivers (ie to reduce reaction time in dangerous situations) under such conditions as bad visibility (fog, rain) or reduced vigilance (night driving). When driving on motorways or main roads with low or moderate traffic. The research took into account the following considerations:
the functional and technical requirements of AC radars;
alternative detection systems (eg, laser, acoustic);
automatic breaking systems;
systems exchanging vehicle data;
antenna parameters;
different methods of modulation.
Practical road trials have been carried out on an experimental system and the feasibility has been demonstrated.

The objective of the research was to investigate performance of a physical communication link between a road vehicle and a roadside beacon in the 1 to 10 GHz frequency range. The research concentrated on characteristics such as attenuation in air or due to a conducting layer on the windscreen near the transmitting antenna. The effect of multipath propagation was also studied and the range and the directivity of the antennas was also regarded as important parameters.

Experimental measurements were carried out on an trial system in a typical urban setting. Measurements showed the importance of reflection and diffraction phenomena for a medium range link. At 10 GHz, it would be quite impossible to have a well defined covered area beyond which no communication was possible. Fluctuations in electric field amplitude were important, however, and from knowledge of the statistical characteristics of fading patterns one can derive the characteristics of the information which can be transferred (eg length, rate, etc).

The research was into an extension of a radar traffic data acquisition sensor which enables it to establish a unidirectional short range broadband communication link between the sensor and a vehicles passing below it. A possible application of the radar communication system is the field of dynamic traffic management.

The center frequency of the link is within the 61 GHz band. This choice of frequency may be available throughout Europe. The message is organized in telegrams each consisting of a fixed synchronization preamble of 64 bits and an occasionally updated data part. The total amount of data transmitted may exceed 50,000 bits at a vehicle speed of 200 kilometres per hour. No channel coding was found to be necessary to provide error free data reception. Nevertheless forward error correction may be advantageous because of attenuation due to windscreens and heavy weather conditions. Subband modulation based on amplitude shift keying (ASK) seems to be the best modulation method.

Structures suitable for monolithic integration of the 61 GHz components was proposed as monolithic integration technology makes possible cost effective mass production of radio frequency (RF) front ends or complete transceiver structures. The radar communication system could be extended full duplex bidirectional communications at the same time as the radar functions.
Two domains for the application of microwave links to RTI systems have been identified: 
- short range (10 to 30 m) road vehicle links in the 1-10 GHz frequency band (such systems will shortly be in mass production), 
- medium range (100 to 300 m) vehicle to vehicle links or anticollision radar, in the 24-36 GHz band. These systems are not so well defined and are just at the prototype stage. 
Initially the project will survey the state of the art including technical aspects, R & D efforts in the field and identified functional requirements. The further objectives of this project are then to: 
- make a comparative evaluation of the three existing microwave technologies in the 2.5 GHz, 6.6 GHz and 9.9 GHz bands for short range communications between roadside equipment and vehicles, 
- compare these technologies with alternative link technologies such as cable systems, infrared light and microwaves in the millimetre bands around 60 GHz. The comparison will be on the basis of performance, cost, reliability and ease of installation, 
- attempt to define more clearly the application fields and requirements for longer range (100 to 300 m) devices for use in applications such as anti-collision systems or for vehicle to vehicle communications, 
- study the feasibility of a low cost radar front end using a planar quasi-optical design, and to evaluate it by means of a laboratory prototype, 
- evaluate in a typical road environment an existing prototype vehicle to vehicle communication link, 
- study the theory and feasibility of (by experiment) a unified link able to fulfil the requirements of road-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle communications.

In support of the pursuance of this objective, the Action is also enhancing the cooperation of academia and research centres with SMEs through the joint design and testing of circuit prototypes of concrete interest to SMEs. This is contributing both to the dissemination of the 'microelectronics culture', even in small companies, and to raise academia's awareness of industrial problems. 
Design, processing and testing of 11 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) prototypes proposed by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) has been carried out. To promote useful exchanges, the design and testing of each circuit has been carried out by mixed university/SME design teams. The prototypes include: 
a programmable delay control and phase generator to be used in echotomographs (which was awarded the first prize as the best industrial chip at EDAC EUROASIC '93); 
a control system for robotics; 
an ASIC for active defence for banks; 
a charge-to-digital converter for high energy physics experiments; 
an ASIC to drive and control test equipment; 
a preprocessor for laser beam bar code scanners; 
an ASIC for the control of diesel engines; 
an ASIC for telemeasurement and telecontrol systems (eg in agriculture); 
a sea-keeping augmentation controller; 
a controller for industrial brushless motors; 
a microprocessor didactic console.
A cluster of more general activities has also been pursued, including the development of a knowledge network in microelectronics (mainly through existing design and testing service centres), increasing awareness of microelectronics capabilities amongst SMEs, and the general dissemination of know-how on ASIC design (for example, through workshops, training courses and publications). 

The Special Action has been implemented, as a priority, in industrial and academic contexts of less advanced technological development. Efforts are focused in particular on southern Italy. However, in the light of the quite low usage of ASICs by Italian SMEs in general, and the need to carry out an effective integration of efforts between the different geographical areas, the association has been welcomed of northern organisations that could act as a bridge towards other European institutes or firms, or that could provide complementary know-how.";;;;;Tecnopolis Csata Novus Ortus;IT;;;

For industrial applicability it is essential that some unity emerges from the competing theories of concurrency, and that the verification process be supported by software tools. The CONCUR Action has explored the relationships between algebraic concurrency theories and has investigated their possible integration. Such algebraic methods deal with the constructs in a program and its specification according to mathematically sound rules in order to show that the program implements the specification. This process is supported by a range of software tools. s.
Concurrency theory (CONCUR) is important for the formal verification of concurrent and distributed programs. The different algebraic approaches to concurrency theory have been explored, and investigations made into the possibilities of integrating these approaches, or incorporating the features of 1 system in another. Appropriate software tools have been developed.

CONCUR has obtained a unified view on the different schools involved in process algebra, classified and initiated the development of a wide range of process algebra extensions and worked towards a common basis for tool design and implementation.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The relationships between and relevant roles for algebraic versus model-based theories of concurrency have been investigated. Methods pioneered in one group have been applied to problems originating in another, and the results compared. In addition to cooperating at the theoretical level, the partners are collaborating through the development, use, and comparison of software reasoning tools, as experience has shown that the development and use of software tools acts as a catalyst for theoretical advances.The tools are being applied in case studies relevant to the European software industry. The work of CONCUR will be continued in a new ESPRIT project 7166 (CONCUR II).

The Action aimed to develop effective techniques for establishing realistic dependability requirements; produce quantitative methods for measuring and predicting the dependability of complex software/hardware systems; and incorporate such methods more fully into the design process, making it much more controlled and capable of allowing design decisions to be based on meaningful analyses of risks and quantified likely benefits.
The process of designing and constructing adequately dependable computing systems was investigated with the aim of making this much more predictable and cost effective than at present. Particular attention was paid to the problems of producing dependable distributed real time systems in which the dependability is achieved by incorporating mechanisms for fault tolerance. An important goal of the research was to facilitate the increased use of quantitative assessments of system dependability as a prerequisite to turning the construction of large computer based systems into a true engineering discipline. To this end great stress was placed on the necessity of taking a systems engineering approach.

The problem of the use of fault injection for testing algorithms and mechanisms implementing fault tolerance with respect to specific inputs is addressed. A global characterization of the fault injection attributes (the faults, the activation, the readouts and the measures) is presented with respect to the various levels of abstraction of representation of the target system used in the development process (axiomatic, empirical and physical models) and the validation objectives (fault removal and fault forecasting). The fault forecasting issues are addressed specifically and an evaluation method is proposed that implements the link between the analytical modelling approaches (Monte Carlo simulations, closed-form expressions, Markov chains) used for the representation of the fault occurrence process and the experimental fault injection approaches (fault simulation and physical injection) characterizing the error processing and fault treatment provided by the fault tolerance algorithms and mechanisms. An approach for the characterization of the faults to be injected for uncovering design/implementation faults in the fault tolerance algorithms and mechanisms has been investigated.

Experience of applying reliability models in the past has shown that the relative predictive performance of the models depends entirely of the context. It has been found that there is no one model that performs well over all data sets. It has also been found that for some data sets all models are in error. In such cases 2 techniques for improving predictive accuracy have been shown to be beneficial. Firstly recalibrating the raw model predictions and secondly using the results of trend tests before applying the models. These 2 techniques may be used separately or in combination. A number of reliability models were applied to failure data collected from a workstation together with the recalibration technique, and the performance of the resulting prediction systems was assessed.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Work was structured into three interrelated tasks: 
-Dependability Concepts and Terminology, investigating the conceptual foundations of the provision of dependability, particularly of predictable dependability, with the aim of developing a systematic, unified approach to the design of fault-tolerant syst ems in order to facilitate the assessment of their dependability characteristics. 
-Specification and Design for Dependability, concerned with gaining an understanding of the principles involved in constructing a development environment for PDCS and an exploration of a number of issues concerned with system specification and design ofparticular importance for dependability (largely ignored by the mainstream of formal specification techniques). 
-Dependability Prediction and Evaluation, concerned with basic techniques for measurement and prediction, with particular attention to their application to fault-tolerant systems and software, and to issues of validation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Dependability Concepts and Terminology: PDCS has been instrumental in developing the concepts and terminology of dependability through involvement in IFIP WG10.4 and other forums. 
-Specification and Design for Dependability: Work on possible means of modelling the effect of the operations environment on the particular dependability attribute of reliability focused on the choice of probabilistic model. Work on specification and des ign for timeliness includes: i. comparison of event-triggered and time-triggered real-time systems, ii. scheduling in real-time systems, iii. testing real-time applications software. Problem of non-functional requirements (NFRs) investigated to provide some taxonomic principles for their classification. In fault tolerance, the emphasis was on tolerating software faults, including i. a systematic survey of the techniques for software fault tolerance, ii. design schemes and notations for structuring software (or software-implemented) fault-tolerance, iii. a technique for producing fault-tolerant software from algebraic specifications, iv. the application of fault tolerance methods to intentional security violations, v. systematic engineering methods for guid ng decisions in the design of fault-tolerant systems. Sub-problems addressed include: i. achieving a high integrity development process, with support from an SEE, ii. techniques for developing highly reliable parallel programs for distributed systems, iii. the design and development of real-time systems, iv. environments for the production of secure application systems. 
-Dependability Prediction and Evaluation: Work focused on: i. a generalisation of the classical, hardware-oriented, reliability theory to cover software, and of the reliability growth models to cover hardware, ii. an extension of classical multiprocessor  models to cover multiple simultaneous breakdowns and/or repairs, iii. modelling of the Recovery Blocks, N-Version Programming and N Self-Checking Programming methods for software-fault tolerance, iv. using testing to estimate parameters for recovery bloc k models, v. extending reliability growth modelling from black box to multi-component systems, vi. a general technique for recalibrating software reliability models which improves the accuracy of reliability predictions under a wide class of circumstances, vii. an investigation showing how reliability trend analysis can help the designer in controlling the progress of the development activities, viii. a study of the basic issues of measurement of software process and product. On analysis of timeliness, wo rk has centred on: i. the prediction of the response time of real-time tasks, ii. dependable communication protocols. Work on statistical assessment investigated: i. theoretical bases to quantify the quality of statistical testing with respect to a given criterion (or set of criteria), including experiments using nuclear reactor control software, ii. methods of fault injection for fault tolerance validation. In the area of security evaluation, the issues of the theoretical bases of possible measures of op erational security and the practical evaluation of security products have been pursued. Regarding ultra-high dependability, we have investigated: i. limits of the various techniques available for validation (reliability growth models, testing with stable  reliability, structural dependability modelling and informal arguments based on good engineering practice), ii. the possibility of augmenting these techniques by explicitly taking account of the process in the quantitative assessment, iii. advantages and  imits of formal approaches to software development for achieving ultra-high dependability of safety-critical computing systems, iv. requirements analysis for safety-critical systems.

All the results obtained are freely available for use by industry. Many partners are involved in the provision of short industrial courses, facilitating industrial take-up. A number of direct links have been set up with various applied industrial research projects, including ESPRIT's FASST (5212), which plans to use some of the methods for modelling and evaluation of dependability that have been developed under PDCS to assist the design of the FASST prototype multiprocessor.

Perfecting the thin-layer interface is very important in making possible higher quality device performance. 
This Action has developed a new field of surface and interface characterisation called 'epioptics'. This has submonolayer resolution and is accurate enough to distinguish single atomic layers of crystals. Epioptics, using light as both probe and signal, enables growth to be characterised in situ and, uniquely, in all growth environments.
New techniques for determining the properties of materials used in information technology devices have been developed. Light is used both as a probe and a signal (epioptics) and extremely high resolution can be obtained. In contrast to existing techniques, epioptics can be used in situ, while growing the crystals, in all the environments employed for this purpose. Applying epioptics to various processes provides new insights into the growth mechanisms involved, thus increasing yield and quality.

The project has shown that light can indeed be used to characterize surface and interface structure, with submonolayer resolution, due to advances in instrumental design, symmetry rules which forbid bulk response, and the discovery of strong, resonant surface contributions at particular wavelengths of light. Carefully chosen systems, which have been thoroughly characterized by conventional surface probes, have been used to establish the credibility of the new techniques from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint.

Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) has been shown to be the most promising all optical technique for real time growth monitoring on commercial reactors. At the end of the project the growth of indium arsenic on gallium arsenic in an molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth reactor was monitored layer by layer, in situ, in real time. An additional spin off from the project was that RAS was show to provide a quick and easy method for checking silicon wafer orientation.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Epitaxial layers, including As, Ga, GaAs and Sb were grown on silicon substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and As and GaAs by photo-enhanced metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (photo-MOVPE). The material was extensively characterised using conventional techniques. A number of purely optical techniques providing complementary information were then used to investigate and characterise the surface and interface of the material with submonolayer resolution in situ. The techniques used were polarisation-dependent reflectivity (spectroscopic ellipsometry, reflection difference spectroscopy and reflection anisotropy), Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence and optical second harmonic generation. 
A strong cooperative theoretical effort underpinned the experimental work.  The Action involved experts in the field of epitaxial growth, materials characterisation by optical techniques, and the theory of the optical response of interfaces.

Foundations are laid for the construction of second generation expert systems which are knowledgeable of the limits of their competence and are more flexible in employing their knowledge. Such advanced knowledge based systems, which have the capability to reason about their object domain models, previously solved cases and associated problem solving strategies in a particular task context. This will allow for a wider range of functions than those possessed by current knowledge based systems.

It was significant that the models were represented in a formal language, so that the computer could interpret them. For this purpose, 2 languages have been developed for describing KADS models: MODEL-K and (ML)2.
A number of prototype systems have been built. These prototypes tackled a variety of reflective tasks such as competence assessment, reasoning under limited time, problem relaxation (solving a closely related but simpler problem if the original problem is unsolvable) and combining multiple object systems.
The development of these prototypes has led to a set of guidelines on how to design and implement systems. These guidelines lay out a number of design decisions plus relevant parameters that must be considered when making these decisions. Aspects that are treated in these guidelines are:
how to realize the model of the object system;
how to ensure a correct (run-time) correspondence between the object system and its model;
how and when to switch activity between the object computation and metacomputation.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Reflective reasoning requires a representation (model) of the object-component to be used by the meta-component, a mechnism for reasoning about and with such an object-model, and a means of controlling the interaction between object problem solver and meta-theory. 
In general any meta-component must be equipped with a representation, a model, of the object-component it reasons about. It is the fundamental hypothesis of the REFLECT Action that such an object-model should be a representation that is independent of the implementation details of the object-system. Thus, instead of applying our meta-theories directly to the object-system, or to some computationally oriented representation of the object-system, we base our meta-theories on an abstract and partial descript ion of that object-system. Newell has introduced the term 'knowledge level' for abstract, implementation independent descriptions of AI systems. Hence we use the term knowledge-level reflection for reasoning about problem solvers using abstract models.Since we want to base our meta-theories on an abstract model instead of basing them directly on computational or implementational details of the object-system, we ahve to clarify what a model should look like. A number of frameworks are available for modellin  or specifying knowledge-based systems. The most concrete frameworks are Chandrasekaran's generic tasks, Steels' components of expertise, the role-limiting method approach and the KADS models of expertise. 
We have decided to use the KADS models because they provide the finest differentiation. They distinguish domain knowledge (declarative knowledge independent of use), inference knowledge (describing the use of domain knowledge, but independent of order) and task knowledge (enforcing an order on the execution of inference knowledge).

For our approach in REFLECT, it is significant that the models are represented in a formal language, so that the computer can interpret them. For this purpose, we have developed two languages for describing KADS models: MODEL-K and (ML)2. 
During the course of the project we have built a number of prototype systems. These prototypes tackled a variety of reflective tasks such as competence assessment, reasoning under limited time, problem relaxation (solving a closely related but simpler problem if the original problem is unsolvable) and combining multiple object-systems. 
The development of these prototypes has led to a set of guidelines on how to design and implement systems. These guidelines lay out a number of design decisions plus relevant parameters that must be considered when making these decisions. Aspects that are treated in these guidelines are: i. how to realise the model of the object-system, ii. how to ensure a correct (run-time) correspondence between the object-system and its model and iii. how and when to switch activity between the object- and meta-computa tion. 
POTENTIAL 
The first advantage of our approach is the possibility of evolutionary development of knowledge-based systems. Our approach allows enhancement of the capabilities of an existing system by adding a reflective component equipped with an abstract model of the object-system. Our experiments show that little or no modification of the object-system is necessary when the meta-component is added. 
A second advance of our approach is that of combinability of several object systems without having to re-engineer these systems. One of our experiments demonstrated how several existing diagnostic systems can be combined into a much more powerful system by adding a reflective module, without the need to modify the individual object components. 
The third, and perhaps most immediate advantage of our approach is that of reusability. Reflective modules implement generic capabilities that are useful for a range of knowledge-based systems. Through our approach, where the meta-theory is separated fromthe model of the object-system, one may expect such modules to be reusable.";;;;;UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM;NL;"INTERFACE CONCILIUM;BSR CONSULTING;ECN - NETH.ENERGY RESEARCH FOUNDATION;Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH";"DE;NL";

17203;AERO0022;DUPRIN;;FP2-AERO 0C;;FP2;Proposal 1003 - Preparation and use of an existing wind tunnel model for ducted propfan investigations;01/07/1990;31/08/1993;;"For improving the efficiency of new and existing transport aircraft for higher Mach numbers (M = 0.8\), the installation of ducted propfans can play a major role in the future. Preliminary limited investigations in national and international programmes have shown promising results. To maintain the European position in the future, more detailed investigations on a large complete model with powered engine simulation are necessary.
This project investigated the aerodynamic engine/airframe interference effects in the context of the new class of ducted propfan engines. The program makes use of an existing wind tunnel model and 2 model engine simulators one ducted propfan and one turbofan. The equipment was completed by designing and manufacturing a second simulator for each engine type. In the wind tunnel program 2 configurations are investigated:
model without engines;
model with 2 turbofans.
The test program covers force distribution measurements and pressure distribution measurements for different Mach numbers, incidence and sideslip settings. Further on, the engine power setting was varied.

To get detailed information about the interference effects the flow field was analyzed using the wing pressure distribution in the vicinity of the engine. In all cases the installation of the engine leads to a significant reduction of the wing leading edge suction peak and to an increase in pressure over the whole span. On the lower surface, the interference effects for this type of engine are small.

The following theoretical calculations were performed:
use of an existing Euler code for investigations of interference effects of agreed test conditions;
coupling of the grid generation procedure and the Euler code with a viscous jet model;
application of a postprocessing technique on the existing experimental data and theoretical results.
In all cases the engine installation leads to a significant reduction in wing leading edge suction peak and increasing pressure on the wing upper surface. This result is in very good agreement with the experimental results. A direct comparison of experiment and calculation of the wing pressure distribution for the model with the turbofan engine is in good agreement for all sections. That means, the solution of the Euler equations accurately models the interference phenomena in this particular low speed case.
The project is based on an existing complete wind tunnel model owned by DLR. Together with the model 2 simulators plus instrumentation, cowlings and pylons exist, ie, one simulator for ducted propfans (DLR) and one simulator for conventional turbofan (DA). The model has a span of approximately 3.5 m and is equipped with a modern wing design for a transport aircraft. The wing has 9 sections of static pressure ports and is available in clean and high-lift configurations. The model will be completed with 2 further simulators (one ducted propfan, one turbofan), including instrumentation, cowlings and pylons. 

With the complete model a first test series in DNW is planned. The investigations will lead to: 
Analysis of installation effects of a ducted counter rotation propfan in relation to a conventional turbofan, concerning low speed interference in combination with unsymmetrical power settings and sideslip angles. 
Experience concerning the behaviour of ducted propfans installed on an airframe. 
Provision of test data for comparison with theoretical calculations, thus improving the flow of information between theory and experiment as well as between industry and research institutes. 

The theoretical work done in parallel will improve the calculation methods of the complex wing/pylon/nacelle structure covering the influence of a jet flowfield. Additionally, the results of the calculations will be used to support the test campaign and provide a deeper understanding of interference effects, while the test results will provide a validation basis for the calculations. In the test series, envisaged at the end of the project, effects of single rotation propfan and high performances are to be investigated.";;;;CSC;Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB);DE;"Aérospatiale Société Nationale Industrielle SA;Alenia Aerospazio - Un'Azienda Finmeccanica SpA;Fokker Aircraft BV;ANALYSIS SYSTEMS RESEARCH HIGH-TECH LTD;British Aerospace Plc;EADS - CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICAS S.A.;GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTRE;MTU AERO ENGINES GMBH;Stichting Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaart Laboratorium;TECHNOFAN sa;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET BERLIN";"FR;IT;NL;EL;UK;ES;DE";

The basic aims are to define, establish and promulgate standards in respect of speech technology assessment. Evaluation and understanding of the performance of speech input/output systems are linked with these aims, and are therefore important tools.

The objective of the project is to develop methodologies, tools and databases for the assessment of speech synthesis and recognition systems in applications where multilingual performance is required from the same basic equipment.

The activities in the main phase of the project focus around 3 major areas:
speech input assessment (including the setting up of tests, their scoring, and the delineation of performance factors involving recognizer tests that have been defined and run on the project's standard personal computer (PC) based workstations, SESAM, using standardized scoring software and cross language work is also being directed towards the definition of recognizer sensitive sensitivity analysis);
speech output assessment (both objective and subjective, including standard multilanguage tests for evaluation at the segment and suprasegmental level have been developed to run on the workstation, using automatic response scoring procedures, together with overall quality measures);
enabling technologies (the specification of speech databases across all the project languages, the definition of uniform protocols for collection and management of speech databases in a standard format and the introduction of agreed methods for multilingual annotation are all examples of work in this area).

The European SESAM workstation has been provided with tools for speech labelling, analysis and input/output assessment, and is already in use. Basic speech knowledge at the physical, phonetic and phonological levels is organized for the language of the project.
The consortium included participants from six EC and two EFTA member states, so that techniques for assessing speech synthesisers and recognisers for eight languages would be produced. The wide participation basis also gives a strong support to the final recommendations.

-Primitives for representing three-dimensional surfaces underlying complex, local spatio-temporal and higher-order spatial operations. 
-Computational procedures using these local operations that can be extracted from image sequences. 
-The flexible and dynamic combination of the various three-dimensional primitives to yield three-dimensional representations and to segment images. 
-The generation of three-dimensional surface models, and the use of prediction to integrate these into object models, allowing the prediction of motor action effects and assistance in object and scene identification.
The perspecitves of neuroscience, psychophysics, brain theory, mathematics and computer vision research are used to study vision processing and develop new ideas on the functioning of vision systems able to operate in a human environment, rather than a simple building block world.

Several novel experimental techniques have been developed: a versatile set up for visual stimulation at 100 Hz physiological experiments: a new stereometer for psychophysical study of ground planes; stimuli for cycloconvergent eye movements in response to disparity; set up for determining accuracy of optic flow estimates; and a new psychophysical technique to study shape from shade.

Results have been obtained on nonlinear interactions of optic flow components in cortical cells, cue invariance of shape representations in cortical neurons, and modelling of cortical cell responses to optic flow componnents. In addition, psychophysical data on texture stereo interaction has been obtained, as well as theoretical progress and experimental data on the use of disparity and its first and second order derivatives in perception of 3-dimensional surfaces; data on the interaction and differences between motion parallax and stereoscopic systems.

Theoretical results have been obtained on the affine second order optic flow, computation of 3-dimensional motion, estimation of local surface orientation using input from orientation selective filters similar to simple cell from mammalian visual cortex, on scale dependent differentiation and representations in scale space. Different methods for estimation of optic flow at the theoretical and practical level have been compared.

Methods have been developed and implemented to compute geometric characteristics of contours, to detect corners, to occlude contours and compute shape characteristics of the 3-dimensional surface near the rim.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Research activities were grouped into four themes: 
-Higher-order local operations, studied anatomically and physiologically in the primate brain and psychophysically in human vision. Optic flow processing is receiving special attention, with the recovery of optic flow and its use in computer vision inves tigated under different assumptions. 
-Combination of multiple depth cues, studied mainly from a psychophysical and computational point of view. The main topics are fusion of depth using cues from texture and stereo, and of structure using cues from motion. 
-Cue combination for image segmentation, studied from a neurophysiological and theoretical point of view. This research is centred on texture segmentation and segmentation by motion. 
-Surface and object representation, studied mainly from the computer vision point of view.

APPROACH AND METHODS 
There were two main means of collaboration. Regular meetings of the participants were held at approximately six-month intervals at which individuals report on their latest work and results. Review talks were given to stimulate general discussion, and visits to the host laboratory made. Under the secondment programme, individual researchers from one participating group could spend an extended period of several weeks visiting another participating laboratory, with the objective of studying in depth the technology or research in progress there. In several cases it has led to the transfer of skills and technology between partners. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS

Engine simulators (turbine power simulators) will also be developed to simulate various types of advanced propeller engines. 

An advanced test rig that will be the basic hardware of a future series of wind tunnel models representing various classes of aircraft equipped with some forms of advanced propellers will be built. This test rig will basically consist of a load bearing skeleton structure containing the model balance, a set of 3 air driven high-power turbines to drive the propellers (engine simulators) and various pieces of test equipment such as wiring, hydraulic tubes, clinometers and electric motors for airframe surfaces remote control, fitted with a variety of airframe shells.
This project specified and designed a wind tunnel tool to investigate the aerodynamic problems induced by the interaction of engine slipstream and airframe at high subsonic to transonic speeds. This tool was a large modular generic wind tunnel model, powered with air turbines for engine simulation.

First of all, the aircraft to be simulated with the GEMINI model were identified and fully defined (specification, shape and general arrangement). A number of alternative parts were included for later use. The wind tunnel operators were also involved in designing all the missing or new interfaces with their facilities (balances, stings, electronics). Then the model design started from both structural and instrumentation sides. Its heart was the skeleton, a primary structure on which the complete set of components (wings, fuselages, tails) was to be fitted in the ad hoc configuration. Its skin was also fully defined on manufacturing drawings. Another important part of the project was the power plant simulator itself. This consisted of an air driven turbine, the propellers and all related instrumentation, such as rotating balances designed to read thrust and torque during the tests. These pieces of hardware were specified and designed by specialists.

All the technical objectives of the project have been met. Even more, a consistent programme for wind tunnel testing has been initiated, including all the procedures necessary for its successful completion. More than 1000 documents (drawings and memorandums) have been produced.

Two phase flow (Gas and Water) appear to be the most consequential phenomena in gas migration and pressure sizing. 

The project is organised in three major steps:

1) A simple problem with analytical solutions
This is a necessary first step which allows assessing the accuracy of numerical solutions in function of given parameters. Such a quantitative evaluation of the numerical codes will be useful to interpret deviations that might occur in simulating more realistic test cases.
2) A few problems based on laboratory or in-situ experiments
Such tests will aim access to the following information:
- the accuracy of the numerical solutions (assuming the existing of good and representative experimental data).
3) A 3-D repository scenario involving the following aspects
- a repository design
- a source of gas 
- rock characteristics
- fluid characteristics

The global objective of the ' TELEMAN 7-VISYS'  project was to develop all  the components for an integrated high performance vision and sensing system for semi-autonomous teleoperation. This was to involve sensor and camera developments, data processing, image interpretation and tools for aiding operator decisions. 
Research is being carried out in order to develop all the components for an integrated high performance vision and sensing for semiautonomous teleoperation.
Several high performance prototype sensor systems have been developed and demonstrated. The dynamic range of a radiation hardened camera has been increased by a faster of 30 using dynamic beam control and has been successfully tested on high contrast scenes. A comprehensive overview of radiation tolerant position sensors identified suitable solutions for most sensing needs. A 3-dimensional system has been shown to recognize and localize representative components such as flanges. A special end effector sensor has been demonstrated for the accurate localization of holes in components, as has a laser beacon scanning sensor for absolute position location during navigation. A 3-dimensional position estimation software module has also been written to fuse data from a combination of different sensors and hence to reduce the uncertainties generated by the individual sensors. Exploitation
The systems are all being exploited for further development and integration into the TELEMAN TM48 - INGRID robust gantry-mounted manipulator research machine project. Moreover, the camera has become a commercial product of AEA; the identified radiation hardened sensors are being used in laboratory and industrial applications at CEN/SCK; KfK is negotiating industrial licencing agreements for the RIALTO vision system; the Univ. Oxford localisation system is being used in cargo handling, and CRIF is exploiting its results in Belgian industrial applications.
Work to be done  

Vision under poor lighting conditions: development of a wide dynamic  range camera with high radiation tolerance. Applications to situations such as flame viewing and poor contrast scenes.      Position detection system: selection and development of rad-hard  internal and external sensors, with data fusion to produce reliable information.     

Environmental sensors and obstacle avoidance: selection of  sensors, detection of shapes, link to CAD data base, and an obstacle detection system.     

Object recognition and localisation: image enhancement, object  localisation, shape recognition, link to CAD data base.     Graphical scene representation: development of man-machine interface  tools to combine on screen synthetic scenes and real images.     

Operator decision aid for task level control: development of tools to  assist the teleoperator to schedule tasks based on the processed geometrical information.     

Test strategy 

Each development was to be subjected to specific representative tests in  simulated environments. Special attention was to be given to good   interfacing between the parts (camera, sensor systems, image processing, etc. ).

A privileged area for cooperation in the European aeronautical community will be this sophisticated and trustworthy heavy numerical simulation, often named 'supercomputing'. 

A key issue in such a perspective encompassing industry project teams, academic and applied research teams involved in common simulation issues (such as Turbulence and Combustion in the ERCOFTAC community), is that of a common data network, enabling a controlled access to either computational tools (software, supercomputers, high parallel computers), or large numerical databases. Such a network assumes a netted backbone, irrigating a large distribution network. 

It can be shown that this backbone should be in the 100 Mbit/s range, taking into account current computer power and model complexities. By the time EASNet becomes a reality, state of the art will have improved both in computing power and in model complexities. A factor of 10 must be taken into account and Gbit/s networking will have to be operated. Such unfamiliar networking issues in the environment of international data links, accounting for strong preliminary requirements such as confidentiality protection and operability, require a common appraisal from qualified aeronautical community representatives.

The 2 year action covered by this contract includes, on one hand, a realistic study of the most critical point, confidentiality protection. Trans-Europe networking experiences between partners will enable (if the critical issue of PTT lines cost is solved), on the other hand, a common know-how to develop for already experienced networking teams. 

These studies and experience on representative pilot applications will enable the build up of reliable specifications for the progressive construction of a full size EASNet, eg: 
EASNet -1  2 Mbit/s backbone over 6 countries in 1992; 
EASNet -2  100 Mbit/s backbone over 8 countries in 1994; 
EASNet -n  1Gbit/s backbone & 10 or 100 Mbit individual access in 1998.

As it is expected that video will play a major part in the different services offered by the future broadband network, the main intention of the project is to prepare a harmonised and compatible family of video coding systems for high quality videotelephony, conventional television (TV) and high definition television (HDTV), including the necessary network and standardised aspects.
A number of compatible improvements have been studied and adaptation to packet networks is under consideration. As the success of videotelephony is critically dependant on keeping the cost down, a hardware model has been constructed, from which the architecture for an integrated codec (consisting of a few very large scale integration (VLSI) chips) has been derived. The realisation of this codec is in progress. In parallel, packet oriented videotelephone codec algorithms making use of one or 2 layers have been defined and subsequent contributions have been made to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
In the field of sound and TV/HDTV coding, the partners in the high quality videotelephone television system (HIVITS) project have contributed to International Standards Organisation (ISO) (sound) and CMTT (TV coding at 34 Mbits{-1}). For this latter application, international agreement has been reached on a solution very close to the HIVITS reference model, and a hardware codec has been built. Connection of this hardware to an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network emulator is under progress.
A proposal to extend this system to HDTV has been established and hardware has been demonstrated. Constraints on compatibility between resoulution standards for the distribution of TV and HDTV signals to the consumer have been clarified. This has led to the concept of compatible or multiresolution coding, now under study by simulation. A firdt architecture approach to compatible coding has been performed.
Technical Approach  

The intended coding scheme is the hybrid (predictive DCT) scheme and the bit-rates aimed at are in the range from about 2 Mbit/s for videotelephony and 8-34 Mbit/s for conventional TV to 34/140 Mbit/s (possibly 280 Mbit/s) for HDTV, depending on the quality required (ie for contribution or distribution). This project involves the definition of algorithms, the specification of required components (VLSIs) and the realisation of demonstrators.  

The project is organised into two application-oriented sub-projects, addressing: videotelephone coding for point-to-point and conferencing applications, and TV / HDTV coding for distribution and contribution applications.  Common groups and workshops are seen as the best means to increase cross-fertilisation between these application-oriented sub-projects at the level of video algorithms and hardware, with the aim of sharing experience and even software or components (VLSI) for sub-functions.  

Key Issues  

- Flexibility, to match the requirements of different applications.  
- Possibility of low-cost implementation in end-user equipment.  
- Compatibility with other elements of IBC.  

Achievements  

The partners in the HIVITS project have strongly participated in the definition of CCITT Recommendation H.261, covering videotelephone/ videoconference applications on channels up to and including 2048 Mbit/s. A number of compatible improvements have been studied and adaptation to packet networks is under consideration.  As the success of videotelephony is critically dependent on keeping the cost down, a hardware model has been constructed, from which the architecture for an integrated codec (consisting of a few VLSI chips) has been derived.  The realisation of this codec is in progress.  In parallel, packet oriented videotelephone codec algorithms making use of one or two layers have been defined and subsequent contributions have been made to ETSI.

A proposal to extend this system to HDTV has been established and hardware has been demonstrated under the auspices of the EBU during the WARC 92 conference. Constraints on compatibility between resolution standards for the distribution of TV and HDTV signals to the consumer have been clarified.  This has led to the concept of compatible or multi-resolution coding, now under study by simulation.  A first architecture approach to compatible coding has been performed.  A first step of the hardware realisation will be performed in 1992.  

Approximately 50 publications and contributions to CCIR, CCITT, and ETSI have been written by the RACE HIVITS partners so far.

This research should lead to improved efficiency and a lower emission of particulates (e.g. soot), NOx and CO2. 
A model experiment is presented as a bridge case between fundamental research and studies on practical combustion systems. The evolution of one diesel spray in high temperature (900 K), high pressure (4 MPa), nearly quiescent (cross flow velocity of 1 m/s), oxidative (air) environment is characterized for 2 injection conditions that are of interest in light duty diesel engines (1.6 and 6 mg/stroke/hole). Laser light scattering and emission imaging have been used for this purpose together with chemical analysis of material sampled with a fast sampling valve, at 35 mm from the nozzle. The structures of the combustion processes for the 2 injection conditions show similar features. The comparison of the diesel combustion structure presented in with those reported in the literature, relative to injections of much higher fuel quantity, suggests that both experimental conditions define prototypic classes fo diesel-like processes, which should be considered as reference models in the analysis of apparatus dependent combustion processes in real diesel engines.

Absorption, fluorescence and scattering measurements were carried out in rich premixed ethylene oxygen flames. Soot and condensed hydrocarbon species concentrations were measured by direct sampling and chemical analysis in the carbon oxygen range from 0.65 to 0.75 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) accounts for no more than 20% of the condensed hydrocarbon species. The early formation in the flames of structures with typical size around 2nm (2500 amu), which do not absorb and fluoresce in the visible, was followed by means of ultraviolet scattering and absorption measurements. These transparent particles were considered to be soot precursors on the basis of their decreasing concentration profile in correspondence of soot inception, as evaluated by both optical and chemical measurements. The soot inception process is characterized by the progressive aromatization of the transparent particles as shown by the progressive shift toward the visible of absorption and fluorescence. The internal rearrangement of a partially aromatic polymeric structure, more than a progressive formation of very large PAH structures, is proposed as a mechanism for soot inception.
Five European car manufacturers (members of the Joint Research Committee) collaborate in this project on Diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient engines for transportation, but future regulations for emission of pollutants such as particulates (e.g. soot) and NOx are likely to be so severe that this objective can only be achieved with a very high technical effort. The  IDEA Project was therefore set up to explore new ways to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. The work in this project is based on previous work carried out under EC contracts (EN3E-049-UK, EN3E-102-D, EN3E-124-F) which resulted in three three-dimensional computer codes of which two are relevant for Diesel engines: the SPEED-SPRAY and the SPEED codes. 

Work in the IDEA programme will be carried out in two areas: computer simulation of Diesel engines and basic R&D on combustion processes in Diesel engines. The programme has been divided into 5 sub-programmes: theoretical work on computer code development and experimental work on the topics: fuel spray, auto ignition, flame propagation, and pollutant formation. 

The SPEED and SPEED-SPRAY code will be further developed and integrated in a code for computation of three-dimensional Diesel combustion processes including models for fuel spray, auto-ignition flame propagation and pollutant formation. Extensive experimental work will be carried out by the participating laboratories on spray behaviour, auto-ignition, flame propagation and pollutant formation. This work should come up with methods to reduce pollutant formation. The experimental data obtained will also be used to validate the three-dimensional computer code for Diesel engine combustion. The use of this  simulation model will make an important contribution to the design of more efficient Diesel engines with a strongly reduced pollution. It will also enable European car industry to reduce time and cost in developing new engines and to maintain its leadership in world Diesel technology.";;;;CSC;VOLKSWAGEN AG;DE;"École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures;Università degli Studi della Calabria;Centre de Recherche en Machines Thermiques;THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR);Complexe de Recherche Interprofessionel en Aerothermochimie;UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID;Advanced Combustion Technologies GmbH;COMPUTATIONAL DYNAMICS LTD;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;Fiat Auto SpA;Institut Français du Pétrole;Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV;GIE PSA Peugeot Citroen;Régie Nationale des Usines Renault;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH);AACHEN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;DARMSTADT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN-NUREMBERG;GEORG-AUGUST-UNIVERSITY GOETTINGEN;RUPRECHT-KARLS-UNIVERSITAET HEIDELBERG;Università degli Studi di Napoli 'Federico II';UNIVERSITAET STUTTGART;VOLVO TECHNOLOGY (CORPORATION);IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE";"FR;IT;UK;ES;DE;SE";

Research is being carried out in order to obtain efficiencies as high as possible by reducing the monocrystalline silicon cell thickness. Efficiencies of 20% at 1 sun and 25% for monocrystalline concentrator cells (under direct beam concentrated light or located into a cavity at 30 W cm{2}) are the target figures of MONO-CHESS. To obtain such cell efficiencies it will be necessary not only to reduce the thickness of the cells in order to increase the open circuit voltage, but also to preserve a high level of light absorption providing optical confinement of the photons.

The following tasks were accomplished:
optimization of textured surfaces and new cell technologies and devices for light confinement;
process development involving techniques for the reduction of recombination and series resistance;
modelling to assess the best structures and the process efforts that must be done first;
measurement of the bonding and cooling of the cells, (in measurements up to 500 suns), spectral response at high injection level and methods of extraction of parameters of the cells;
cell processing which involved combining the preceding successful techniques to obtain high efficiency cells.

These results have achieved an efficiency of 19 to 20% (1 sun) and 24% concentration.
To obtain the mentioned cell efficiencies it will be  necessary not only to reduce the thickness of the cells in order to increase the open circuit voltage, but also to preserve a high level of light absorption providing optical confinement of the photons.

It consists of a modelling, a laboratory mock-up and an in-situ test carried out at Mol facility in Belgium.
In a first phase, this consists in developing methodological tests not on core samples but on remoulded highly compacted clays. This procedure provides an appropriate control of the hydrical and mechanical history of the sample, making possible to understand the real hydrous phenomena.
In a second phase, an in-situ test will be carried out to validate the mock-up results. Using an accurate apparatus, this phase allows to reach some parameters and their time-dependence that can't be measured on a mock-up. With this short scale, it will be possible to evaluate the usefulness of a gallery ventilation test and to assess its technical feasibility: air conditioning system, porous lining conception and planning.
Modelling of hydrical transfer has been achieved. The main parameters are the relative humidity of the air and the saturated clay permeability. The model shows that the desaturation effect will concern a few square metres area around the openings, sufficient to affect the clay mechanical parameters and so the mechanical interaction between the clay and the lining. Under repository conditions the desaturated area should be independent of the radius of the gallery.

The modelling was used to dimension the mock up apparatus. The specifications have been defined according to the safety regulations. The apparatus mainly consists of an oedometer and a controlled ventilation system. Both are under test before starting the experimental phase. The in situ test, blowing dry air into a borehole in order to desaturate the clay through a porous lining, has been roughly defined. The emplacement, the drilling mode and the peripheral instrumentation have been defined on the basis of the results from the model.
Work programme:

Modelling
This initial phase consists in developing a simplified model of the hydrical transfer, in isothermal condition and without mechanical coupling (constant volume and porosity). This allows to study the parameters sensibility and to propose a first evaluation of the hydrical behaviour of the clay medium under a ventilation effect (orders of magnitude of water fluxes, desaturation area and phenomenon duration) on the basis of the present data.

Mock-up tests
The mock-up tests aim to well understand the phenomenology of hydrical exchanges between a controlled humidity air and the initially saturated clay, and to validate the model. It consists in conceiving and manufacturing an apparatus to test under high stress a clay with a cylindrical opening in the centre that simulates the ventilated gallery. At the end of each test, the mock-up is dismantled in order to measure the hydrical state around the opening.

In-situ test
This phase will be carried out at Mol underground facility. It will consist in drilling an horizontal borehole with a porous lining and an adequate peripheral instrumentation. The ventilation of this borehole will be controlled (dry temperature and relative humidity) and the amount of extracted water measured. Simultaneously the measurement of the clay hydrical state around the borehole will allow to evaluate the desaturation line. The experimental results will be compared to the model predictions.";1300000;650000;;CSC;NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCY OF FRANCE;FR;BELGIAN NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE;BE;

The approach is based on the definition of local software development environments, without prior assumptions of cost drivers or their relationship to effort/cost. This in turn is based on assessment of the most significant problems in the classical methods of cost estimation (such as COCOMO and FPA), and is a synthesis of DeMarco's concept of phase-based measurement and the Badly-Basile meta-model approach.
At present, resource estimation is an art which is not widely applied in software engineering environments. Much of the dissatisfaction with current estimation tools lies in their dependence on size metrics, which cannot be established with any accuracy until well into the development life cycle.

The aim of the MERMAID project is to improve support for estimators and project managers in the area of effort forecast, risk analysis and progress monitoring. The approach is based on the definition of local software development environments, without prior assumptions of cost drivers or their relationships to effort/cost.

A programme of research has been carried out to improve the understanding of the nature of the relationships between observed development productivity and selected productivity cost drivers. Data has been collected from software development projects both within the partners' organizations and externally from collaborating organizations. In parallel, extensive knowledge elicitation has been carried out through interviews of experts in the field.

A generalized data model of the software development process and a comparative evaluation of existing cost estimation tools have been completed. Results of knowledge elicitation are also available and a prototype toolset was delivered.
The testing of the MERMAID hypotheses is virtually complete and is proving the underlying assumptions generally correct. The research results have been translated into product specifications to be included in the final version of the MERMAID toolset.
A commercial version of the prototype implemented on a personal computer (PC) under disc operating system (DOS)/Windows and operating system (OS)/2 was delivered and a final version is scheduled for completion in October 1992. A system for the collection of project data has been implemented on a PC and is being used to analyse user project data.
In the area of risk analysis, a prototype has been developed and a further development of this will be integrated into the final MERMAID toolset.
The approach was implemented by several increments of the MERMAID toolset. An initial Sun-based prototype was used to test the basic assumptions and hypotheses of MERMAID. The feedback from the user community was so positive that it was decided to proceed towards a commercially usable version, running on PCs with either MS-DOS and MS-Windows or OS/2.

Towards this objective a joint European effort will be conducted to investigate the aeroacoustic mechanisms of rotor noise generation by means of a comprehensive wind tunnel test programme. The unsteady pressure distribution on rotor blades is determined through a large number of pressure sensors embedded in the blade contour. By simultaneously measuring the radiated acoustic signals for a large variety of 'flight-conditions' ( take-off, high speed, horizontal flight, landing approach, high-g turns), a comprehensive database will be obtained which allows the new advanced prediction codes and improvements to existing codes for helicopter external noise.
Theoretical results 

The methods applied differ mainly with respect to the necessary computation effort and the physical effects addressed. Different levels of code complexity correspond to the different stages of the helicopter design process. For the first estimation, a rough and relative simple computation is needed, whereas for the final lay out, sophisticated theories are mandatory. So, the work of Bristol University leads to a saving of computer time by partial use of prescribed wake configuration. The approach of ECD and ALFAPI concentrates on blade vortex interaction under neglection of compressibility effects. The latter aspect is addressed by the work of Morino. 

The partners AGUSTA, CIRA, ALFAPI, IST and Bristol University established codes for the prediction of rotor noise created by different sources, viz thickness, loading, quadrupole and broadband noise. The theoretical approach was performed in the frequency and time domain. The procedures differed between the Farassat and the Lowson solution of the Ffowes Williams Hawkins (FWH) equation. A work share existed in the addressing of different noise sources. In the areas, where the same problems were tackled by different partners, future comparisons between the theoretical and experimental HELINOISE results will help to identify the superior theoretical approach. 

Experimental Results 

The test results will serve as data banc for the verification of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic prediction codes and as a tool to explain the complex physical background of rotor noise generation and radiation. The data comprise in detail: 

- radiated acoustics 

- sound pressure time histories 
- narrowband spectra 
- mid-frequency summary level contour plots 
- low-frequency summary level contour plots 

- blade surface pressure 

- time histories (in the azimuth), 
- chordwise distribution 
- (per one revolution) azimuthal distribution 

- vortex trajectories 

- blade vortex miss distance 

- blade deflection
The tests will be conducted in the best aeroacoustic wind tunnel in existence, the DNW, using a high quality modular rotor test stand. The model rotor will be a large scale (40%), to avoid scaling towards full size problems. 

The helicopter exterior noise prediction methods will be developed for high speed and blade/vortex interaction, impulsive noise and broadband noise. They will be based on the pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface, which is the source of the rotor noise radiation. The pressure distribution will be evaluated by advanced aerodynamic codes taking into account 3-dimensional, unsteady and compressibility effects. 

The wind tunnel tests will provide a validation of both the aerodynamic and the acoustic prediction results and thereby control and improve the codes. The prediction codes will permit consideration of noise constraints in the early design phase of  a helicopter rotor system.";;;;CSC;EUROCOPTER DEUTSCHLAND GMBH;DE;"University of Bristol;CENTRO ITALIANO RICERCHE AEROSPAZIALI SCPA;BRUEL & KJAER SOUND & VIBRATION MEASUREMENT A/S;GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTRE;Institute of Computational Engineering Alfapi SA;INSTITUTO SUPERIOR TECNICO;Agusta SpA";"UK;IT;DK;DE;EL;PT";

The reliability of a TELEMAN machine is affected by environmental factors such as dust, water, vibrations, heat, and ionising radiation. The effects of many of these factors on the components and materials in question were well known, but knowledge was missing about the effects of large doses of ionising radiation (1000000 Gy) which were relevant here. Furthermore, there was a need to collect knowledge at system level, i.e.  about complete TELEMAN machines. Components and materials which are especially susceptible to radiation damage are: electronics, sensors, fibre optics, signal communication systems, insulating materials, lubricants, and adhesives.
The reliability of a TELEMAN (robot) machine is affected by environmental factors such as dust, water, vibrations, heat, and ionizing radiation. The effects of many of these factors on the components and materials in question are well known, but knowledge is missing about the effects of large doses of ionizing radiation (1E6 Gy) which were relevant.

Reliability analysis tools have been developed in order to incorporate radiation degradation in the analyses. Reliability analyses have been carried out for a number of robot types and a number of reliability data have been collected.

A widely representative range of components and materials have been radiation tested and the test results have been collated in the TELEMAN database along with data provided by the participants from their earlier work. Radiation data handbooks (2) have been written and published by Siemens and AEA Technology using information generated within the project. Data has also been exchanged with the corresponding radiation tolerance database run by the European Space Agency. The data has been disseminated to the other TELEMAN participants through a regular newsletter and on floppy disc.
Exploitation
The results of the project are already being exploited through radiation testing of components other TELEMAN projects. In addition, the data has been exchanged with the European Space Agency, and two radiation data handbooks have been published, ensuring broad exploitation of the results. The TELEMAN TM48 - INGRID robust gantry-mounted manipulato research project is also exploiting results from TM41 - ENTOREL to assess the reliability of the integrated research machine.
Work to be done  

In order to assess how much the various factors influence reliability, the 'TELEMAN 41 - ENTOREL'  project was to provide data as well as models for the calculation of the reliability of the machine as a function of time and exposure. Furthermore, failure strategies were to be developed to plan the difficult task of recovery of stranded machines.  Reliability data already existing with the partners and elsewhere for relevant equipment was to be collated in a data base. Possible gaps in the existing data were to be covered by component or materials testing. Concurrently, reliability models as well as other models for the assessment of the behaviour of the machine were to be set up. A very important part of the work throughout the project was to be the collection of data and other information from internal and external (to TELEMAN) sources and the dissemination of this information as well as information generated by the project to the partners of all the TELEMAN projects.

The aim of the LOTOSPHERE project was to foster the exploitation by industry of mathematically sound formal design techniques. This was achieved by project engineering and by using a viable, fully tool supported, formal system design and development methodology.

17187;AERO0014;EUROVAL;;FP2-AERO 0C;;FP2;VALIDATION OF CFD CODES;01/02/1990;31/03/1992;;"The aim of the project is to improve the quality of existing CFD codes, as well as their range of applicability. Furthermore, and especially to lower costs in design processes, the existing variety of numerical tools needs to be validated against accurate and detailed measurements, in order to enhance performance, robustness and user-friendliness of the codes.
Partly due to the rapid increase in computer power, speed and performance, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an increasingly important role in the predesign as well as design stages of aircraft development by lowering costs and providing information on critical flow processes.

This project was an initial contribution towards validating advanced modelling methods for a broad range of aerodynamic flows directly relevant to civil aviation. Particular emphasis was put on the performance of turbulence models for maximum lift and high lift, single element aerofoils and multielement aerofoils and on shock boundary layer interaction in transonic conditions over aerofoils and bumps in channels as well as over wings. Other areas focussed on boundary layer schemes, tunnel interference effects, vortical flows including vortex breakdown and problems which arise when extrapolating wind tunnel data to free flight conditions.

It has provided new insight into CFD capabilities and has delivered important guidelines on which computational approaches are promising in several application areas.

Multiple investigations have been performed on the main influences that may affect Navier-Stokes solutions such as turbulence modelling, grid effects and wind tunnel correction parameters. It has been shown that the quality of the results obtained indeed may strongly depend on these influences. There was some significant scatter in the results presented. Concerning the mesh influences and the performance of turbulence models, some basic tendencies became visible.

The mandatory grid that has been used in most of the tests seemed to affect the solutions to a certain degree in general. The main disadvantage of this grid may be seen in the absence of adequately condensed streamwise step sizes within the shock region, preventing by this a more satisfactory resolution of the lambda structure at the shock foot. Hence, better agreement was achieved between computations and the experiments just by using different grids of higher density.

The turbulence models employed had the most significant impact on the solutions. There were drawbacks in all models and their performances sometimes turned out to be different in different flow situations. Modifications of the most common Baldwin-Lomax model, such as the Granville extension or the Goldberg backflow model, have been shown to perform to a significantly improved level of accuracy in the separated flow regime. The 'half equation' nonequilibrium models of the Johnson-King class turned out to be very promising, although the well known deficiencies that cause an unsatisfactory skin friction representation still prevent a 'break through' of this model type. The Johnson-Coakley variant, originally designed to overcome this drawback, had been tested also, but, for the test cases investigated here, this model did not succeed.

Due to the non-condensed mandatory grid that most of the computations have been performed within, the more complex turbulence models such as transport and stress models did not succeed to a superior degree over the algebraic models, which was caused by the impossibility to resolve for the shock lambda structure.

The results computed depended on the way the wind tunnel corrections were introduced. This, however, is not really a numerical effect acting on the solutions, and so there is little that can be done as long as the applications aim for free flight conditions rather than to account for the wind tunnel environment (which, however, is possible but is connected with considerable increase of computational effort).
To achieve a better understanding of turbulence models with respect to their influence on flow prediction, commonly used algebraic, 1-equation and 2-equation turbulence models as well as Reynolds stress models will be investigated. 

For the design process (for single as well as for multi-element aerofoils) it is of prime industrial importance to compute maximum lift situations and to validate them properly. In addition to these investigations and for the purpose of method evaluation, calculations with both free air and tunnel boundary conditions will be compared to achieve corrections to free flight conditions. 

With respect to the already available industrial experience in 3-dimensional calculations for wings and complete aircraft and the need to improve the corresponding codes, work will also be performed on the 3-dimensional validation-against-measurement process, in particular for flows about wings. One special objective is to investigate vortical flows with respect to the prediction of vortex breakdown.";;;;CSC;Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH;DE;"ANALYSIS SYSTEMS RESEARCH HIGH-TECH LTD;British Aerospace Plc;Computer Applied Techniques Ltd.;EADS - CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICAS S.A.;CENTRE EUROPEEN DE RECHERCHE ET DE FORMATION AVANCEE EN CALCUL SCIENTIFIQUE;CFD NORWAY AS;GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTRE;Danmarks Tekniske Universitet;Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB);Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA);Saab AB;Stichting Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaart Laboratorium;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET BERLIN;Universite Libre de Bruxelles;UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY";"EL;UK;IE;ES;FR;NO;DE;DK;SE;NL;BE";

It will do so by moving towards the establishment of a single, universally agreed method of certifying computer-based, safety-critical systems and by reporting the cost-effectiveness of various approaches to software reliability measurement. Accordingly, the objective of the project is to demonstrate the use of advanced reliability techniques for the selection of safety-critical computer systems.
A 4-channel, safety critical computer based system has been developed. The development of the 4 diverse software versions focused on a variety of methodologies, each using different tools and techniques, and each originating from different project teams. 4 teams each designed one of the channels, one designed the test environment, and 2 teams act as licensing bodies. The main stages of the project have been:
the provision of cost effectiveness measurements of currently available methods and tools for creating and assessing software systems for safety related applications (from industrial trials);
the preparation of guidelines for the production and assessment of computer based systems for use in safety critical applications;
the evaluation of the level of reliability achieved by combining a number of diversely produced channels in one configuration;
the provision of a benchmark environment as a basis for a service to European enterprises involved in the development of safety critical systems.

A control application in a nuclear plant was selected, and the parameters drawn up to assign development work to the teams. All channels passed the simple acceptance tests and were delivered for integration into the demonstrator/test harness at the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA). The product and process data from the channels was collated and sent for consistency checking to AEA. Assessment data was also collected for subsequent analysis. The first phase of the system testing of the channels showed a number of errors that required repair before testing could continue. Preliminary analysis of the development data was carried out. Repairs to the channels were completed and a second phase of testing started. Analysis of the assessment data commenced with the production of system models and the use of the software lifecycle assessment technique (SLAT) to establish the risk of using a particular lifecycle. Phase two of the system testing was completed. The Prometrix tool was used to provide metrics of the product source code, allowing comparison of the source and the productivity achieved by the different lifecycles employed.
DARTS is based on the design and licensing of a four-channel, safety-critical computer-based system. The development of the four diverse software versions will focus on a variety of methodologies, each using different tools and techniques, and each originating from different project teams. Four teams will each design of one of the channels, one will design the test environment, and two teams will act as licensing bodies. Once a licence has been granted, the prototype system will be installed in the test environment. An evaluation of comparative channel performance and of the selection process will be provided by monitoring system performance.

The application of advanced technologies for health and usage monitoring will have a major impact upon achieving this goal. 

The 4 European helicopter manufacturers, Aerospatiale, Agusta, MBB and Westland Helicopters, supported by engine manufacturers Rolls Royce and operators Irish Helicopters, have agreed to collaborate in research in this field. This will ensure that each benefits from the others' experiences in planning and executing a future European strategy. By combining experience, the collaborating companies are uniquely qualified to undertake this study.
A review of accident and defect data was undertaken; this identified those areas that would benefit from the application of monitoring systems. 

Various configurations of HUM systems wee assessed. A combined system incorporating on-board data processing and additional ground based analysis was preferred. This was considered the most practical configuration to cover a wide range of applications. It was considered that additional reductions in overall operating costs could be achieved by integrating the HUM system diagnostic outputs with current maintenance procedures. 

Certification issues were reviewed. Existing procedures for the certification of avionics are not directly applicable to HUM systems and require further development. 

HUM systems must produce highly reliable diagnostic indications. Clearly instrumentation technology is crucial to achieving this goal. A review of sensor performance identified current weaknesses and some potential solutions. Improved methods of processing can also help to reach this goal and to this end some novel analysis techniques were assessed; these show promise but require further development. 

Usage monitoring (principally for rotor systems and transmissions) offers the potential to reduce the frequency of overhauls and thereby reduce costs. At the same time airworthiness can be improved by more accurately identifying damaging flight regimes. A trial transmission usage monitoring system was developed during the programme. 

Various rotor monitoring systems were reviewed. Whilst achieving satisfactory performance, additional development should permit a wider range of defect modes to be identified. 

Established transmission monitoring techniques (both vibration and debris analysis) were assessed in test programmes using seeded faults to replicate a variety of defect modes. Fault seeding methods were developed which demonstrate that naturally occurring defect modes can be reliably reproduced. 

Existing monitoring techniques developed for large fixed-wing aircraft engines have been reviewed for potential application to helicopter engines. In addition, current methods of transmission vibration monitoring have been tested on engine vibration data. Although certain differences were noted, in both cases it should be possible to adopt these techniques. Reduced operating costs are again predicted, with added safety benefits. 

Further work is now required to expose advanced HUM techniques to widespread in-service operation. Improved safety and reduced operating costs can be expected.
The work will commence with a detailed study of previously encountered or potentially likely modes of failure and the efficiency with which these modes of failure are presently monitored. Possible monitoring strategies will be reviewed and their impact upon certification and operation assessed. 

Having established the need and identified priority areas, consideration will be given to the development of monitoring techniques where they are presently shown to be inadequate. 

In addition to their impact upon airworthiness improvements, application of these technologies is expected to lead to reduced maintenance costs and improved aircraft availability, directly reducing operating costs and therefore improving the marketability of the companies' products.

The major target of this work is to combine and integrate process steps which are required for submicron application specific integrated circuit and memory device fabrication in complementary metal oxide semiconductor or bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology in an automated manufacturing system, where the wafer is transported under vacuum conditions from one process chamber to the next. AST Elektronik GmbH has built up and integrated a rapid thermal process (RTP) chamber into the clusterline concept CLC 9000 of Balzers. RTP offers a cold wall system for high temperature wafer processing. In contrast to furnace annealing the wafer itself is heated very quickly to high temperature by radiation. This minimizes contamination. As a cold-wall system RTP collects the advantages of vacuum and low pressure technology. In highly integrated circuits, manufacturing in silicon technology is often a high temperature and atmospheric pressure process step combined with a low temperature and low pressure step, sensitive to ambient and surface contamination. Integration of the process sequence into a multichamber high vacuum system can avoid ambient and surface contamination problems. This would be helpful for various processes like titanium silicidation or aluminium reflow. The RTP cell could be used on a modified basis also for other applications.

The main aim of PROMIMPS is to combine and integrate process steps required for submicron application specific integrated curcuit (ASIC) and memory device fabrication in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar of bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor (BICMOS) technology. Using an already developed and tested multichamber equipment platform with up to 9 separate process chambers, the integration of the following 3 multistep processes for the fabrication of multilayer interconnections is being realised:
advanced multimetal sputtering;
metal chemical vapour deposition (CVD);
dielectric planarisation.

In situ measurement and control of vacuum and process conditions (during the process) and an online examination (after the process) of deposited films lie within the scope of the project.

A multimetal sputter system was manufactured and, after successful acceptance tests, was shipped for process development and qualification. The RPT module has been integrated with the system. The prototype module for W-CVD was developed and installed. Functional testing is under way. The plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) module is near completion and will be evaluated.
In situ measurement and control of vacuum and process conditions (during the process) and an online examination (after the process) of deposited films lay within the scope of the project. 

An important objective was to demonstrate the technological advantages of integrated processes and their cost-effectiveness, including yield and wafer cycle time considerations. Process integration demands process isolation, the cleanliness of the deposit, and a high vacuum environment during transport between the process chambers. The standard equipment configuration is a single wafer processing, cassette-to-cassette fully automated system. Modules capable of performing one or more process steps are fitted to the central handling unit, allowing the integration of up to nine vacuum-isolated process steps.

Computer codes for modelling either simple geometries or flows are now mature and in routine use by aerodynamic engineers. The current thrust of research and development is towards the modelling of complex configurations and flows. This trend places a heavy burden on the ability to generate computational meshes of a consistently high standard. Rapid progress through collaborative research is required if Europe is to retain a competitive edge. 

The main objectives of this mesh generation project are therefore 2-fold. Firstly, general purpose grid generation techniques are to be developed for multi-block methods. Several complementary approaches will be explored by the partners. The second major objective is to investigate techniques for improving mesh efficiency and solution accuracy. Mesh embedding can be used to refine blocks locally without a global propagation of unnecessary mesh points. In addition, by allowing the grid to  adapt itself dynamically to regions of high error or flow gradient an improved standard of solution can be obtained.
Within the intended scope of the two year project EUROMESH was considered successful by its participants. The project did not provide solutions to all of the questions asked and indeed raised many new issues to be addressed in subsequent projects. However, in addition to making progress within many key areas the project brought together for the first time Europes leading workers in a vital area of CFD technology. The project was conducted in a tremendous spirit of cooperation and the value to all of regular, in depth discussions and reviews cannot be overstated. The project highlighted key deficiencies in the area of mesh adaptation which need to be urgently addressed.

8301;1689;VIMP;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Vision-Based Online Inspection of Manufactured Parts;01/01/1989;31/12/1994;;"The aim of this project is to develop a vision-based online inspection system to detect faults in manufactured parts immediately after their machining and assembly. 

Manual inspection methods are slow and can normally only be performed on a random sampling basis. With automated production lines it is necessary to determine, at each critical step of the manufacturing process, whether parts have been manufactured correctly. Automated inspection will increase production rates and lead to substantial savings in material and labour. 

Classical inspection methods compare a reference part with the set of parts to be evaluated. The approach taken in this project is to compare the image from an online vision system with an image derived from the data stored in the CAD system. To provide sufficient resolution it is necessary to move the sensor to scan the full extent of large workpieces. The 3-D data stored in the CAD system will be rasterised in a 2-D projection corresponding to the angle of view of the sensor and to the processed real image content. 

The system is expected to have considerable potential within the inspection systems market, which is forecast to constitute a substantial proportion of the machine-tool market. Applications are particularly expected in the automotive and aerospace industries, but there may also be applications in fields which do not currently use online inspection methods, such as the textile industry. Some of the system components (eg image processing and 2-D and 3-D pattern-recognition software) are expected to be exploited as products in their own right.";;;;;Université de Strasbourg I (Université Louis Pasteur);FR;"Universität Fridericana Karlsruhe (Technische Hochschule);Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG);Speroni SpA;Caption";"DE;IT;FR";

SCRIPTOR is a recognition engine of dynamic cursive script, acquired through an electronic paper device, that can be trained to a specific writing style, in order to facilitate incremental learning. The input is a file of raw data and the output is a file of word alternatives, in order of decreasing confidence. SCRIPTOR consists of 5 processes that communicate via message passing in a UNIX environment.
Firstly, the preprocessing, normalization, and codification module. The raw data are divided into strokes according to the speed profile of the pen. Each stroke is represented by means of a code of 9 integers.
Secondly, the preliminary recognition module, that transforms the sequence of coded strokes into a table of partial matches to be used to produce the output recognition file.
Thirdly, a module that integrates the graphic information stored in the table of partial matches with linguistic knowledge stored in a dictionary. It operates by successive approximations, looking at the number of strokes and at islands of confidence in the table in order to restrict the search in the dictionary.
Fourthly, a module that allows the allographic databases to be updated during the normal use of the system in order to achieve the functionality of incremental learning. The user operates as a critic in a reinforcement learning paradigm. No intervention is interpreted as a positive feedback as recognition operation. An explicit intervention is required to correct the error of the system.
Fifthly, a module that manages the database of allographs, considered as self organized neural networks of prototypes. Hebbian learning is used for tuning the network and an original technique has been implemented for controlling its dynamic growth of the network.

Many people still rely on pen and paper to carry out their daily work either because they find a computer too difficult to use of insufficiently mobile.

Research efforts are devoted to investigating:
methods, algorithms and techniques for online recognition of cursive scripts and for processing language related data;
architectures suitable for the implementation of these techniques;
electronic paper devices and gestural man machine interfaces.
In carrying out its work, PAPYRUS draws on the results of other ESPRIT projects and academic studies in handwriting recognition.
The project contributed to the advance in the basic technologies needed to pursue this aim.

8731;5279;HARNESS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;European Distributed System Integration Project;01/12/1990;31/05/1993;;"The move towards decentralised information processing has highlighted the need for interworking distributed applications platforms across heterogeneous hardware and software systems. A common platform would achieve this by providing an interface between specific distributed applications and the underlying software and hardware. Such an interface would allow applications to run in a multivendor environment on different machines across different interconnected systems. 

Amongst the most notable initiatives aiming at the availability of such a platform are the ECMA SE-ODP standardisation and work undertaken under the aegis of the CEC. The sheer size of the effort required to define and implement such a distributed application platform means that multiple steps are required: the HARNESS project is the next step. 

HARNESS aimed to integrate the results of various ESPRIT and other projects into a Common Distributed Application Platform supporting the execution of distributed applications on various heterogeneous hardware products, so enabling interworking to be achieved. It used standard components. To ensure that the platform is competitive and meet market expectations, existing and emergent standards will form its basis wherever possible.
The move towards decentralized information processing has highlighted the need for interworking across heterogenous environments. Several basic distributed platforms have been implemented, both in ESPRIT and elsewhere. European distributed system integrated project (HARNESS) is capitalizing on these developments by integrating 2 of these approaches (ISA and COMANDOS) into a single integrated distributed application platform capable of spanning multiple underlying hardware and software systems.

The HARNESS applications platform is applicable by users of multiple computer systems, supporting different operating systems. They are typically the environments in which users need to access services throughout the computer network, without worrying about physical location of such services. Typical examples are the cooperative development of software systems, and the linking of multiple departments to optimize the flow of information (such as in a typical production chain: sales, production planning, production scheduling, purchase of raw materials, expedition, administration).

HARNESS has delivered specifications for the distributed application platform. Based on these specifications, the implementation of the distributed applications platform is in an advanced stage. The development of the various tools and application to be adapted to HARNESS is well under way.
HARNESS first defined the platform specification, taking into account both user requirements and the availability of components: it is based on the consortium's experience and an in-depth survey of both the needs and positions of the various actors (users, hardware manufacturers and software houses) and the current state of the art. 

The platform is defined by a set of interfaces to application programs and implemented as one or more layers on top of the different systems and networks. It is based on the integration of the best available technology using different European hardware platforms. To allow reuse of results from other platform projects, its implementation is based on Unix systems. The platform is intended to be readily adaptable for use on other operating systems. HARNESS placed strong emphasis on capabilities for allowing new components to be integrated later while keeping the same interface, thus allowing the platform to evolve. 

To ensure usability, different sets of tools has been integrated in the platform software package for management and the development of applications. The platform was demonstrated and used to support applications which both lend themselves to distributed implementation and have complex requirements. It was thus possible to assess the effort needed to migrate from existing industrial practice onto HARNESS as well as the costs and benefits of the platform itself. 

The HARNESS project aimed to establish a strong relationship between users, providers of the platform and of services mounted on it, other European projects, and standardisation organisations. This relationship is used in the further definition and dissemination of the platform as it evolves.";;;;;CAP Volmac Service Development &;NL;"Siemens AG;VOLMAC NEDERLAND BV;Datamont Feruzzi Group SpA;University of Dublin;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;UNIVERSITAIRE INSTELLING ANTWERPEN;COMMUNICATION NETWORKS RESEARCH GROUP;ENSTA-LIES;KAPSCH;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;CAP Gemini Innovation;British Telecom plc (BT);ANSA Architecture Projects Management Ltd;Bull SA";"DE;NL;IT;IE;PT;BE;EL;FR;AT;UK";

This will show that ODA is relevant to all the facilities of a general networked office system, does not technically restrict functionality or choice of products, and offers positive advantages in system integration. The work will be based on the system architecture stemming from the PODA-2 project in order to integrate ODA more fully into the functionalities of an existing office system.

In PODA-2 (project 2374), the ODA standard has been advanced in areas such as partial documents, hypertext, data in documents, 2-D tables, automatic content generation, annotation and revision control. In addition, the relationship to relevant standards from OSI communication protocols and security concepts is being established. Some of the work will result in prototypes. 

The PODA-SAX project will capitalise on PODA-2 by pooling its results with those of related projects in order to demonstrate an integrated ODA-based office system. This system will include the achievements of the PODA-2 work which demonstrated the interchange of compound documents between different editing systems. Most importantly, however, it will: 

- demonstrate the extended functionality of ODA beyond the existing ISO standard ISO 8613:1989 
- demonstrate the applicability of the ODA Application Programme Interface (API) 
- demonstrate integration with the results of the work on security and on the use of OSI communication protocols

The objective is to articulate a theoretical framework for doing this and to develop the requisite methods and prototype tools.
The aim of the maintenance validation and documentation of software systems (REDO) project is to facilitate efficient, high quality software maintenance. This can only be conducted if well structured documentation relating to the software is available. The project is therefore developing abstraction recovery (reverse engineering) methods and tools to permit the regeneration of such documentation from the software, including design specifications. Maintenance can then be performed at a high specification level.
Restructuring (reengineering) tools will also be developed to optimise software structure and hence to improve the efficiency of the maintenance process. An optimised software structure is also an essential precursor to the use of reverse engineering tools.

The aim of the project is to assist software engineers in the maintenance, restructuring and validation of large software system and their transportation between different environments.

problem definition;
domain specific prototype applications;
research and development in maintenance and validation;
the application of knowledge based systems;
toolkit construction and integration;

The focus has so far been on reverse engineering, and 2 approaches have been taken. 1 is pragmatic, relying on structured query language (SQL) as an interface to a database repository of the data required in the reverse engineering process. The other relies on a fine grain object oriented repository with associated schema descriptions.
An intermediate language has been designed with business applications in mind, and progress has been made on user interface issues. A handbook on reverse engineering, of interest to software maintainers, has been produced.

Whilst precise figures vary, there is general agreement in the software industry that over 50% of software costs relate to ongoing maintenance and support. 

Although a number of tools are available to assist in the maintenance of large commercial applications, these primarily focus on the syntactic analysis of source code, and fail to adequately address the semantic content of such representations. The result is that current maintenance support tools offer little benefit to maintainers of software. 

The aim of DOCKET is to build upon the current research and tool-base to provide an intelligent reverse-engineering toolset capable of addressing semantic-related issues. Particular emphasis will be placed on ensuring that knowledge about a system and its domain is captured in a natural and expansive manner, thus avoiding the need for the user to grasp new modelling notations and concepts. This will be achieved by supplementing existing source-code analysis techniques with document analysis and end-user interaction, enabling the effective interpretation of source code.

The related goals are to improve the integration of currently available modelling tools with one another and with the design process, and to extend their scope to cope with new systems architectures and increasingly complex designs. These goals are supported by the objective of providing the means whereby performance modelling tools and techniques can be used effectively to support systems design and development.
The main objective of the project is to provide a graphically based environment for constructing and executing performance evaluation models at 3 usage levels: system designers, modelling experts and tool designers.
The system consists of a set of tools communicating through an object management system and a graphics support system addressing the areas of system specification, model construction, performance evaluation techniques, and experimentation and report construction.
Development work will be focused on the development of the support environment, tool integration and the extension of tool functionality. 

Among the features of the environment to be developed are: advanced graphics work-stations; an extensible tool-set supporting alternative performance-modelling paradigms, queue-networks, process-interaction, and Petri-nets; the integration of tools via a common object management system; graphics support and reporting facilities; and a structured system specification. Integration with system engineering environments is an important consideration. 

The toolset will be targeted on the application areas of computer systems architecture, real-time systems, and distributed systems; there will also be evaluation exercises in the areas of network systems, computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), and information systems.

This software was to be initially targeted at the transputer-based Supernode machine (ie the major output from project 1085). An overriding design aim was to provide software portable to other DMPC platforms. 
Parallel computers are already used to solve many science and engineering problems. A good example is the Supernode computer developed under ESPRIT project 1085 and now marketed by PARSYS (United Kingdom) and TELMAT (France). A price/performance ratio some 10 times better than sequential computers give them the potential to be used in many more market sectors. To realise these benefits in larger markets a more extensive software infrastructure is needed to ease the development or porting of applications on these machines. SUPERNODE II is building the principal parts of this infrastructure.

The project aims to design and develop appropriate operating systems and environments for general purpose parallel, computers for a range of tasks, including run time support, program development, multiuser support, and real time applications.

An operating system kernel (PAROS) that is resident on each processing element in the system has been produced. Various high level servers are in development, such as an X Windows/Motif and various file servers. Performance monitoring tools are being provided as well as full networking facilities.
A number of user interfaces and environments are being constructed on top of PAROS, including an X/Open compatible system and the portable common tool environment (PCTE). 2 integrated project support environments (the PACT toolset and Eclipse) are being ported to the PCTE running on the parallel machine and are all being fully parallelized. Software tools are being developed that make use of the facilities offered by PAROS and will readily interface to the parallel PCTE. 4 large applications (image synthesis, simulation of heterogeneous systems, computer aided design (CAD) for very large scale integration (VLSI) and oil reservoir simulation) have been implemented and have provided a test bed for the major software components developed in the rest of the project, particularly the numerical libraries, the compilers and PAROS.
Software components were to be thoroughly integrated through clearly defined interfaces using existing standards (eg X/Open, PCTE) where appropriate.

The issues involved in vision based robotics systems have been addressed. It was concluded that complete autonomy, although desirable, was not practical within current restrictions. The methodology of design was discussed and it was found that common to all methodologies was intuition based upon experience in the field.

A system was developed which was capable of inspecting a 300 mm by 280 mm circuit board containing 360 components in 50 seconds and 200 components in 39 seconds, averaging 7 components per second. The system proved far more reliable than manual inspection procedures.

A skeleton system for actively maintaining an interpretation of a scene has been developed. It uses rule based recognition procedures triggered by constantly active demons, thus permitting event detection and identification.

When contextual or semantic information was available, or some interpretation of the scene was required, it was found that a combination of knowledge based and computational systems was necessary. The combined system was able to exploit artificial intelligence tools and control techniques for error recovery.

Model based tracking was used to develop a system for vehicle monitoring and proved adequate under various conditions of lighting or weather. The system relies on a prior knowledge of the objects it will encounter.
VIEWS addresses R&D issues in the field of computer vision related to situation representation and reasoning and real-time control of various asynchronously arriving data-streams. VIEWS will also include the provision of support tools for acquiring the scene and object knowledge. 

The VIEWS system prototype will be integrated into a generic architecture using a number of different components developed by the project partners, and will be demonstrated in two areas of application: 

- surveillance of ground traffic in airports, and in particular, surveillance of aircraft servicing vehicles on apron areas at airports, for efficient aircraft turnround 
- surveillance of vehicle traffic on roads and motorways for traffic control purposes. 
These demonstrations will be developed and assessed in close cooperation with potential end-users (airport and road authorities).

2785;BIOT0187;PIGMAP;;FP2-BRIDGE;;FP2;The development of a genetic and physical map of the porcine genome;01/02/1991;31/01/1994;;"To produce a genetic map with markers spaced at approximately 20 centiMorgan intervals over at least 90% of the pig genome. To produce a physical map with at least one distal and one proximal landmark locus mapped on each porcine chromosome arm and also genetically mapped.
The pig gene mapping project (PiGMaP) has brought together laboratories in 6 EC countries and 2 EFTA countries in a coordinated and collaborative programme to develop a porcine gene map. The pig pedigrees and polymorphic genetic markers necessary for genetic (or linkage) mapping have been established. The number of genes assigned (or mapped) to chromosomes approaches 100. Techniques for physical sorting the pig chromosomes have been exploited to develop chromosome specific libraries (or gene banks). Consideration has been given to the future exploitation of the gene map in locating the genes responsible for controlling traits such as growth and reproductive performance.

The reference animals necessary for the genetic (or linkage) mapping are provided by 5 groups. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from these animals is shared by a wider grouping of ten laboratories. A pilot linkage study involved 7 groups genotyping a shared pool of animals. DNA prepared from 12 primary pig x mouse hybrid cells have been distributed for synteny mapping studies. Chromosome specific libraries have been created by combining chromosome sorting in some laboratories with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cloning in other laboratories and the libraries have subsequently been distributed to other participants. Groups isolating markers have collaborated with those using in situ hybridization to assign marker loci to chromosomes. In particular lambda and cosmid genomic clones which have been shown to contain polymorphic microsatellite loci are being mapped to chromosomes. The development of short interspersed elements (SINE) priming involved a three way collaboration.

Five laboratories took part in a meeting in June 1991 to discuss the design of the experiments to map the quantitative trait loci (QTL). The recommendations for the design of the reference mapping populations made at the June meeting have subsequently been adopted.
At the initiation of the project the gene map of the pig was rudimentary, with only 38 genes assigned to 17 linkage or synteny groups and only 27 tentative chromosomal assignments. 

A genetic map with markers spaced at approximately 20 centiMorgan intervals over at least 90% of the pig genome will be produced. The map will include a mixture of genes previously mapped in man and mouse, porcine coding sequences and hypervariable loci with high polymorphic information content (PIC). Diverse genetic stocks (European commercial pigs, European wild boar and Chinese Meishan pigs) are being used to provide crosses informative for linkage analysis and known to be segregating for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of economic value. Purebred, F1 and F2 animals are being genotyped for the markers isolated within the project and for known polymorphisms (biochemical, blood groups, etc).  
The data are being analysed with the LINKAGE computer package. Between species synteny and DNA sequence conservation means that cloned human and murine genes can provide dispersed markers to build a basic porcine map to be gradually fleshed out with more variable markers. Probes detecting variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or minisatellite loci in the pig are being developed to allow isolation of locus specific probes with high PIC values. Highly polymorphic microsatellite loci formed from simple oligonucleotide repeats dispersed throughout the genome are also being used as they offer the means of rapid, automated genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. 

A physical map with at least one distal and one proximal landmark locus mapped on each porcine chromosome arm and also genetically mapped will be produced. The porcine karyotype is uniquely suited among farm animals for physical mapping studies. Hybrid cell lines and in situ hybridisation techniques are being used to assign genes to chromosomes and chromosomal regions. Further stable and well characterized hybrid cell lines will be developed within the project. Participants with access to fluorescence activated cell sorters (FACS) will develop a flow karyotype and procedures for sorting individual chromosomes as an alternative to hybrid cell lines and as sources of single chromosomes for the creation of chromosome specific libraries. In addition to complementing the genetic map the physical map will allow the conservation of synteny between pigs, man, mice and cattle to be evaluated. 

The statistical techniques required to analyse data from QTL mapping experiments are being developed and evaluated. Studies for the detection of quantitative trait loci will be designed but only implemented after the completion of this initial gene mapping project.";;;;CSC;BBSRC Roslin Institute;UK;"Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA);WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY;THE SWEDISH UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES;THE ROYAL VETERINARY AND AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY;NORWEGIAN SCHOOL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE;Universiteit Gent;Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht;Universität Hohenheim;THE BABRAHAM INSTITUTE";"FR;NL;SE;DK;NO;BE;DE;UK";

- 2D methods are operational for unsteady helicopter flow, and they constitute a useful step in developing 3D algorithms 

- for a hovering rotor, Euler methods, which capture the rotor wake, give good results for the first calculations made, but additional investigations are necessary on the wake structure, 

- in forward flight, only potential methods are operational presently, and they can give good comparisons with experiment if an unsteady, fully conservative algorithm is used; nevertheless, improvements are necessary in code robustness to compute complex blade planforms, and a finite-difference formulation is probably not the best formulation for that purpose, 

- the development of more sophisticated methods is necessary for the future; to predict the rotor performance, viscous effects will have to be included in the model.
The work concerns the application of CFD codes for rotor blade design. Starting from a review of existing CFD codes, improvements to the codes and targets for code performance will be defined. These various codes will then be appropriately developed and tested against selected test cases. This will highlight the most beneficial directions for future work in this field. 
Review of the current computational methods with respect to their capabilities and validity limitations. 
Consideration of anticipated results expected from the various CFD methods. Definition of targets for the improvement and further development of the methods. 
Selection of appropriate test cases for the comparison of the methods, adjusted to their different capabilities. Operational conditions considered are: 2-dimensional steady and unsteady; 
3-dimensional steady (hover flight) with and without lift; 
3-dimensional unsteady (forward flight). 
Development, improvement and testing of the various computational methods. Comparison of results with corresponding test data and methods of other partners. Comparison with the targets.

- To measure the incidence of proctocolitis and Crohn's disease in the North and South of Europe in a prospective study using common criteria of case-definition, uniform approach to case-ascertainment and a Common Protocol.
- To standardize and harmonize methodologies and protocols in epidemiologic research in the field of IBD between the North and South of Europe.

Detailed chemical and, particularly, mineralogical analysis including the use of a number of novel techniques, demonstrated clearly the heterogeneity of ore types and the differences in composition of similar minerals between these types, especially with regard to impurity composition. 

A series of closely monitored trials and collation of historical performance allowed actual plant performances to be analysed in the context of feed type and process conditions. Calculation methods for reagent selection were developed and the performance of selected ligands evaluated. Synthesis of optimised reagents is now possible. 

Basic flotation research demonstrated a number of significant parameters for certain ores, notably in regard to grinding media, pulp oxidation/Eh and reagent combinations. These results, in combination with those of previous stages, were generally demonstrated by laboratory and pilot testing and allowed plant circuits to be modified to immediate advantage. Metallurgical tests showed two routes in particular, a chloride process for copper concentrates and a leach method for lead concentrates, to be of promise for future research and development. 

Overall the results provided a number of improvements of advantage in complex sulphide flotation and gave strong indications as to how to progress further by the use of extractive metallurgy.";;;;CSC;Sociedade Mineira de Neves Corvo S.A.;PT;"NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF ITALY;Pirites Alentejanas SA;Almagrera SA;Andaluza de Piritas SA;Boliden Mineral AB;Empresa de Desenvolvimento Mineiro SA;INSTITUT NATIONAL POLYTECHNIQUE DE LORRAINE;NATIONAL LABORATORY FOR ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY;Swedish Mineral Industry Research Organisation";"IT;PT;ES;SE;FR";
36039;BREU0574;ATTAIN;;FP2-BRITE/EURAM 1;;FP2;Application of transient thermography to advance industrial NDT;01/03/1992;28/02/1995;;"The objectives of ATTAIN were: 
- the detection cracks, disbonding, and adhesion failure in plasma sprayed coatings 
- detection of thickness variations in ceramic, metallic and organic coatings and bulk materials 
- high resolution inspection, and measurement, of thermal properties of thin films and substrates for microelectronics components
Static pulsed LITT 
Static pulsed LITT in the nanosecond time resolution regime has been shown by both heat flow studies and experimental measurements on iron-zinc coated steels to have a sensitivity to coating thicknesses in the range 1-10 um and to the microstructure of alloy coatings in the near surface region of coatings in this thickness range. Heat flow studies have shown that the laser pulse duration needs to be reduced to the hundred picosecond timescale in order to neglect thermal diffusion effects in metals during the finite pulse duration. The finite pulse duration, and a strong parameter correlation between the optical absorption coefficient and the thermal diffusivity in the analytical expressions for the LITT transient are the major obstacles to a simple analysis of the pulsed LITT transient for the extraction of the thermal diffusivities of materials. A methodology to overcome these effects, based upon the application of an ultrathin (0.1 um) metal overlayer to ceramics, has been demonstrated to result in a thermal transient whose shape is independent of the influence of optical absorption. Further work on the analytical theories of heat flow, and technological developments to produce picosecond timescale LITT, are recommended. Nanosecond pulsed LITT has clearly demonstrated potential as a laboratory based analysis tool for thin coatings, in terms of controlling drift in both microstructure and in thickness as a function of process parameter drift. Standard laser flash diffusivity measurement of bulk thermal diffusivities has been demonstrated using nanosecond scale laser pulses, demonstrating the feasibility of combining this technique with pulsed LITT in a single instrument. 

Flashlamp thermography 
A new thickness measuring device for organic coatings on steel strip and other substrates has been developed, using standard, inexpensive components. The technique has shown promise to, and interest from, Spanish steel industry. 

Scanning LITT 
A novel, imaging transient thermography technique has been developed, using a scanned laser beam and a single infrared detector. The technique is applicable to a wide range of coating materials, and the wavelength of the laser can be chosen for optimum absorption by the surface. In most cases, a low power sealed CO2 laser is the best choice (CW power 20-50 W typically). Scanning LITT has been shown to be applicable to ceramic, metallic and organic coatings of thickness in the range of 10 um to several mm, although the technique's particular strength is its applicability to coatings at the thin end of the range. For these coatings, there is at present no other imaging transient thermography instrumentation available that has the speed to detect the fast transients induced in such thin coatings. The scanning LITT instrument is controlled by software that was developed for the purpose and offers data - and image analysis options. 

Scanning LITT is of special interest to the turbine manufacturing industry, since many blades are coated with thin plasma sprayed or electrodeposit thermal barrier coatings. However, there are also several other areas of industry, such as coated steel strip production and aerospace, which too have shown strong interest in scanning LITT.
ATTAIN deals with the development of a non-invasive inspection technique, transient thermography. The concept of passive thermography is not new; indeed infrared cameras and sensors have long been used to monitor equipment in operation for incipient failure, to measure the temperature of components in general, to inspect factory buildings for insulation faults and so on. Transient thermography, for surface inspection, was first used in the late 70's and early 80's, but has since then remained very much a laboratory technique without significant use in industry. 

The innovation in ATTAIN is the development of transient thermography for industrial applications. Without the technique, the surface of the object under investigation is briefly and gently heated and subsequently observed with an infrared detector. The rate of penetration of the heat into the object is a measure of the heat conduction of the surface and can be interpreted in a number of useful ways. For example, it can show underlying defects in a coating, or can be used to measure thermal and electronic properties in thin films. 

ATTAIN focusses on two distinct application areas of transient thermography, each of which has its own specific technical requirement. The first area, Laser Irradiation Transient Thermography (LITT), uses a laser which is used to heat the surface rapidly, followed by the observation of the decaying surface temperature with an infrared detector. This technique can be used in a number of ways; for example, scanning LITT uses a scanned laser and a scanned detector, where the time lag between the laser and the detector is fixed so that differences in the observed temperature must be due to sub-surface defects or changing surface conditions. Scanning LITT is especially useful for the inspection of very thin or very 'fast' coatings (i.e. with a very high thermal diffusivity), and curved objects. In static pulsed LITT, the laser and detector are not scanned over the surface under inspection. In this way, the whole of the surface temperature decay curve is recorded, rather than a single temperature measurement at a fixed time after heating, as in scanning LITT. The temperature curve can then be used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the material under inspection. This is highly relevant for the quantitative characteristics of substrates and thin films for the microelectronics industry.";;;;;AEA Technology plc;UK;"Asociación de la Industria Navarra;British Steel Technical;University College;Oxford Framestore Applications Ltd";"ES;UK;IE";

- to understand the role of the informal and formal (health) care systems in managing (coping with) chronic, incapacitating diseases (ic rheumatoid arthritis), 
- the interactive influence of clinical change, psychological characteristics and social support on the quality of life of RA patients, 
- to describe and compare the patterns of care that exist for RA patients in European countries and how these patterns may influence outcome (quality of life, course of the disease). 

The increase in the number of chronically ill patients in an ageing society has an enormous impact on health care institutions, apart from the consequences chronic illness has for the quality of life of patients and their families. 

As Governments become increasingly concerned with the costs and benefits of the varying health care systems in Europe, the analysis of the relationship between formal and informal care systems (ie health care system characteristics, professionals involved in care, social support and family care, substitution in care) on the one hand, and the effects of these care systems on 'health outcomes' (ie survival, functional status, quality of life) on the other hand could have major policy implications.

The coast-goal is 1.5 ECU/Wp. 
Gettered and textured Polyx wafers have been processed to fabricate 2 x 2 cm{2} cells. The 240 minutes 900C gettered wafers had a maximum efficiency of 15.6%. Cells which had received a hydrogen plasma treatment showed the best efficiency.

Further optimisation of the phosphorus gettering was done. The worst results are due to some impurities in the conveyor finance which are counterbalancing the effect of gettering.

It is possible to improve drastically the electrical properties of P type multicrystalline silicon samples by phosphorus diffusion. Hydrogenation of the material could be beneficial as this passivating agent is able to neutralise recombination centres introduced by impurities which cannot be gettered like oxygen. Gettered impurities are iron, copper and nickel.

The polycrystalline material studies shows such features is as grown conditions, its behaviour being comparable to single crystal silicon. Material performances at high boron concentrations are controlled by a deep recombination centre, whose concentration is determined by dopants and oxygen concentration. Even at high R values, donor compensation with phosphorus does not affect the electronic properties of the material. The formation of boron-phosphor complexes can compete with boron-oxygen recombination centres. Free oxygen concentration must be kept as low as possible.

2 deposited or grown glasses improve the bulk carrier transport properties in classical thermal processing. All doping processes give almost the same gettering efficiency, as the classical annealing is not sensitive to external contamination. As RTA is an efficient method for the detection of contamination it has been confirmed that the chemical vapour deposition deposited glass is superior to the spin on one if a rapid thermal diffusion to form the pp{\} contact.

Annealing in argon of the aluminium-silicon structure dramatically increases the effective minority carrier diffusion lengths Ln.

A fundamental study of the silicon/silica interface was carried out. The increase in electrical response that could be gained by oxidation could be counterbalanced by a decrease caused by precipitation of oxygen and metals on specific defects.

Photochemical etching is a new process to prepare the surface of silicon. Promising results were obtained using this process for microscopic texturing and passivation of the emitter of photovoltaic cells.
In the first phase of the programme the different technological strengths the groups will be further elaborated and compared. The comparison of the different techniques will be based on technological and economical grounds. Those techniques that are found successful will be taken over by the indus tries in this project and will lead to more cost-effective cells with higher efficiency, preferably on substrates made by partners within the consortium. Of course all the evaluation techniques present at the different partners will be optimally used to give feedback to the technology. In order to meet the efficiency and cost goals, mentioned above, different work topics are identified  and investigated in order to increase the efficiency of the polycrystalline silicon solar cells : 

Material (substrate, wafer) improvement : the material quality has to be improved at the ingot and at the wafer level. Gathering techniques are of prime importance to be studied. On the wafer level the interest especially goes to thinner wafers (100-150 microns) to reduce the overall recombination volume and to reduce the material cost. 

Back surface field : because of the trend for thinner wafers the diffusion length will comparable or larger to the wafer thickness and there fore it will become sensitive to surface recombination at the back side. Different techniques will be tried to realize the BSF. 

Optical confinement : because of the thinner cell interest, light will be not fully absorbed on the first passage  through the cell. Optical confinement will become important and will be investigated to increase the optical pathlength. 

Frontside passivation and antireflection coating : in order to increase the blue response of the cells, the emitter junction has to be doped less and/or has to be thinner. But then one has to avoid an increase in dark saturation current and hence a decrease in open circuit voltage. Therefore it is advisable to use a very effective surface passivation technique, combined with the antireflection coating. 

Selective emitter: in the same context as point 4 the blue response can be enhanced by using a thin emitter. But under the metal fingers one can not passivate the emitter surface.Therefore the emitter junction has to stay deep under the metal fingers. This results in a selective emitter concept. 

Contacts: contacts are and stay of prime importance in the solar cells. The contact resistance and sheet resistance have to be low and on the other hand the coverage factor has to be as small possible. New concepts are envisaged such as laser grooving, combined with wet chemical metallization and the improvement of the screenprinting process (smaller line widths). The outcome is the choice of some techniques as production-ready(performance and cost). Therefore the proposal is also well-balanced between industrial interest and research laboratory interest.";;;;CSC;INTERUNIVERSITAIR MIKRO-ELEKTRONICA CENTRUM VZW;BE;"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE;Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie l'Energia e l'Ambiente (ENEA);Italsolar SpA;Photowatt International SA;SOLTECH NV;UNIVERSITE DE LA MEDITERRANEE D'AIX-MARSEILLE II";"FR;IT;BE";

A multimedia workstation for clinical communications has been developed for consulting between specialists in medical procedures. The technical objectives of the product are summarised as follows:
 definition and development of a platform with a documental database which allows storage, retrieval and editing of multimedia documents;
 definition and development of an application to allow interactive communications;
 implementation of an electronic mail for multimedia documents;
 provide flexible communications media through narrow and broadband interfaces;
 adapt a man machine interface to the user requirements.

The main aim of the research was to define, specify and develop a prototype multimedia applications environment in the health care sector for use with the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and to evaluate its usage. The research took into account:
the special requirements of health care professionals;
security, speed and operation in clinical environment.

The project carried out an analysis of the generic requirements of professional user groups and the specific requirements of the health care sector. Development of the multimedia work place facilities gave real users the opportunity to experiment, and in some cases put it into everyday use. The system was improved and demonstrated to the users by means of hands on training. Feedback has been obtained from the usage of the system by professional user groups in real environments.
Technical Approach  

The pilot has established close working relationships with groups of hospital consultants working on at least two hospital sites in each country concerned (UK, France, Spain, Finland).  These consultants have been provided with multimedia terminals linked together with ISDN at 2B\D or 30B\D rates on which multimedia working is implemented.  The target users are intended to be representative set of the generic 'professional user group'.  The key user characteristics being that they are groups of high value staff, working with confidential and sometimes valuable data, located on separate sites but sharing a common culture.  

In each country a different pilot experiment  has been performed according to local requirements and the technology preference of the local MultiMed partners. Results are being gathered and compared on an international level.  

The project will continue to gain user feedback on health care for the RACE URM, and to increase the functionality provided to users.  

Key Issues  

- Special requirements of health-care professionals.  
- Security, speed, operation in clinical environment.  
- User-friendliness.  

Achievements  

During 1988, the project carried out analysis of generic requirements of professional user groups and the specific requirements of the health care sector and it identified and specified the technologies it would use.  

Development of the multimedia work-place facilities began during 1989, and in 1990 real users were given the opportunity to experiment, and in some cases put it into everyday use.  During 1991, the system has been improved and demonstrated to the users by means of hands-on training.  Feedback has been obtained from the usage of the system by professional user groups in real environments.  The pilot has been offered to the IBC/LAB and a plan has been prepared to show the demonstrator in Seville during the Expo'92.  

A major achievement was that the MultiMed prototypes in Rennes and Nantes were used at the launch of France Telecom's NUMERIS in that region to demonstrate the capability of ISDN.  

Expected Impact  

A significant improvement has been achieved in the accessibility of multimedia health-care information for professional (not IT-trained) users, resulting in faster and more accurate diagnosis and therapy.  Within the RACE programme the main impact of the project will arise from the provision of data on IBC usage within the health care sector, and on the evolution of user requirements from local to geographically spread multimedia applications.";;;;;APD;ES;"Sopha Médical;Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL);Bayer Diagnostics;Sistemas Expertos;APSIS;Oxford Brookes University;Medical Computers France;Oxford Consultants (Europe);Technical Research Centre Finland;LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY";"FR;UK;ES;FI";

Testing tools and equipment were not produced, but relevant requirements were specified.  ITACA identified (formal) description techniques, suited to the specification of an IBCN Conformance Testing Service.  Methodologies for automated test generation and running were also defined.  

The following main objectives were identified:  

. scope and harmonisation of an IBCN conformance testing service; identification of suitable IBCN testing scenarios  
. identification of the IBC test tools; definition of their functional architecture, and specification of relevant basic technical requirements  
. identification of the IBC test purposes at different abstraction levels; definition of the IBC test suite structure as grouping of test purposes   
. identification and evaluation of suitable (IBC) test description techniques  
. definition of methodologies for an automated approach to (IBC) test generation and run. 
Project ITACA aimed at identifying methodologies procedures and tools, needed to define an integrated broadband communications network (IBCN) Conformance Testing Environment and implement in the near future a corresponding conformance testing system able to handle the high data rates of integrated broadband communications (IBC). Testing tools and equipment were not produced, but relevant requirements were specified. ITACA identified (formal) description techniques, suited to the specification of an IBCN Conformance Testing Service. Methodologies for automated test generation and running were also defined.

Achievements of the project were:
identification and evaluation of the state of the art of IBC protocol reference models (PRM), reference configurations (RC), protocol conformance testing (PCT) and (formal) description techniques ((F)DT);
definition of a suitable protocol conformance testing scenario for the IBC environment leading to the production of an overall technical analysis on the IBC PCT;
preliminary definition of guidelines to IBC test specification;
preliminary definition of guidelines to automation in test generation and test run.
Technical Approach  

ITACA stems from the view that normative and/or prenormative activities in the domains of protocol conformance testing and IBCN design are developed in isolation, with almost no concern for applicability of existing testing methodologies to the IBC environment. In this regard, two significant topics may be considered:  

. a vast majority of the presently-defined methodologies, procedures and tools have been developed for conformance testing of OSI protocols  
. several reference models have been, and are still being, designed for modelling IBC; most of these define logical IBCN architectures which may depart significantly from OSI.  

As a result, there is plainly a need to harmonise the domains in which both testing and IBC protocols are being developed.  ITACA aimed at defining such an integrated approach, and at identifying how test generation and run can be performed automatically.  

Key Issues  
. Scope and applicability of IBC protocol conformance testing (PCT).  
. Target of IBC PCT (ie identification of a consistent IBC environment, suitable for testing development purposes).  
. IBC PCT scenarios, specification and automation of testing, test tools and facilities, procedures harmonisation.  
. Consensus formation activity on IBC network and IBC PCT specification.  

Achievements  
. Identification and evaluation of the state of the art of IBC protocol reference models (PRMs), reference configurations (RCs), protocol conformance testing (PCT) and (formal) description techniques ((F)DTs).  
. Definition of a suitable protocol conformance testing scenario for the IBC environment leading to the production of an overall technical analysis on the IBC PCT.  
. Preliminary definition of guidelines to (IBC) test specification.  
. Preliminary definition of guidelines to automation in test generation and test run.  
. Active support of RACE consensus formation, notably through the distribution of the above results, extensive participation to the development of RACE common functional specifications and participation in workshops and seminars.  

Expected Impact

Special emphasis was placed on market penetration aspects for integrated broadcast communications (IBC) services and equipment, and on comparative regional studies. A standardized technoeconomic evaluation procedure for the evaluation of the cost effectiveness of IBC network components, subsystems and terminal equipment, as well as for the analysis of demand for IBC services was developed.

In line with this evaluation procedure 2 tools, the Budget Cross Flow Model (BCF) and the Cross Impact Model (CRIMP), as well as a heuristic method for generating and evaluating SCENario Trees (SCENT) were adapted to the needs of RACE, thus contributing to a core of common personal computer (PC) based evaluation tools for the RACE community.
A first attempt to synthesize IBC introduction scenarios into a European Community (EC) aggregate was made.

The evaluation procedures and tools developed will have positive impacts for the next phase of the RACE programme in several respects, by:
helping to organize better currently available information in order to evaluate more precisely thecomparative benefits of long term IBC investment strategies;
assisting RACE pilot projects and RACE supported IBC field trials in the evaluation of the technoeconomic feasibility of tested IBC applications and services in future markets;
contributing to the development of a common language for communication between RACE projects in the field of technoeconomics and IBC demand analysis.
The main objective of TET-ADAPT was to provide RACE project consortia with a set of tools for the techno- economic evaluation of their activities.  Special emphasis was placed on market penetration aspects for IBC services and equipment, and on comparative regional studies.  

As part of an effort to define the 'semantics' of RACE project activities, a standardised techno-economic evaluation procedure for the evaluation of the cost- effectiveness of IBC network components, sub-systems and terminal equipment, as well as for the analysis of demand for IBC services was developed.  

In line with this evaluation procedure, two tools - the Budget Cross Flow Model (BCF) and the Cross Impact Model (CRIMP) - as well as a heuristic method for generating and evaluating SCENario Trees (SCENT) were adapted to the needs of RACE, thus contributing to a core of common PC-based evaluation tools for the RACE community.  These tools were provided to selected RACE consortia on a zero-fee licence basis.  The license included necessary tool support - installation, provision of tool documentation and maintenance - as well as training courses and course materials.  

In some cases, joint deliverables with the licence- taking projects were produced.  For example, in conjunction with REVOLVE (R1028), comparative country studies were undertaken using CRIMP.  A common set of key performance indicators were applied to a typical EC core country (Germany) and to three more peripheral countries (Greece, Ireland, Spain) on varying levels of telecom development, in order to understand both the similarities and the differences with respect to the introduction of IBC.  Also, a first attempt to synthesise IBC introduction scenarios into an EC aggregate was made.  

It is expected that the evaluation procedures and tools developed in TET-ADAPT will also have positive impacts for the next phase of the RACE programme in several respects, by:  

. helping to better organise currently available information in order to evaluate more precisely the comparative benefits of long-term IBC investment strategies

identification of relevant physiological parameters for monitoring, their appropriate sampling frequency and finding the ideal position within the body for measuring and for recuperation in the slaughterhouse; 
development of suitable packaging in order to avoid migration, solvation, and repulsion of the system within the body, taking into account the integration of appropriate sensors with the facility to sterilize; 
development of appropriate sensors and power source, which should be very small and of long life; 
development of the electronics and the telemetric animal machine interface; 
testing of the precompetitive product in practical farming conditions, transport and slaughterhouse procedures. 
The aim was to integrate progress in knowledge of animal stress physiology within new technological based systems for intensive animal husbandry. More specifically, a precompetitive read and write intelligent biosensor which can measure body temperature, physical activity and tissue conductivity of pigs. The biosensor communicates via a computer system by signal transmission and stores relevant animal data thus conferring a form of electronic passport for each individual animal. Full applications will help to reduce medical treatment of animals, reducing chemical residues in the meat which can impair human health. An integral part of the project has been the development of sensors for monitoring physioloical changes, combined with the redesigning of the temperature measurement and transponder chips.

The application of batteries in transponders requires the development of very small batteries. To fulfil the requirements, the battery should have a high volumetric energy density. In order to optimize the battery development a case study has been made with respect to the anode, the electrolytes, the cathodes, the complete cells, the cell construction and the selection of technology for the transponder application. This has allowed the practical development of batteries.

Development of a data acquisition unit and allied software have resulted in a system which is used within current experiments for collecting data on body temperature by telemetry during housing and transport of piglets, thereby allowing the identification of physiological parameters.
Prior devices and systems for monitoring animal data have concentrated primarily in the area of wildlife biosystems. Such wildlife tags, being mostly implantable transmitters and receivers for low level signals from animals by telemetry, are well developed. The problem with farm animals is that such implants are expensive and implantation requires surgery under general anaesthesia. External tagging devices, while cheaper, tend to get lost and can be unreliable. Implants can measure quickly the physiological response to heat stress, feeding and exercise. However, there remains a substantial need for a commercially acceptable long life, and long range telemetry system for accurate monitoring and identification on a group or herd basis. 

Within the proposed project focusing on pig farming, an intelligent biosensor will be developed based on an injectable long life telemetry system, having the appropriate sensors for animal physiological monitoring and identification. The device will be applicable in methods of harvesting and collection within intensive animal husbandry systems thus enhancing animal performance, optimizing subsequent processing and marketing, and avoiding undesirable side effects on animal and human health. 
The innovative features will be a combination of advantages with respect to biosensor monitoring: injectable, precise, cheap, with read and write facilities from and to individual animals kept within a group, providing them with a form of electronic passport.";;;;CSC;KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN;BE;"Davy McKee Ltd;Seghers Hybrid NV;Sonnenschein Lithium GmbH";"UK;BE;DE";

It consists of a independent CAD system and a CAPP/CAM - system. The CAPP/CAM system consists of three possibilities to generate a process plan. The great advantage of this architecture is, that in every case a complete and valid process plan can be generated. The integrated NC-system automatically calculates the toolpaths with no differentiation between the modules which generated the process plans. 

The SESAME system is an engineering/design system which can be used to reduce product development time and cost. With SESAME mechanical parts can be designed which can be manufactured cost effectively with very short lead times while product quality is maintained or increased. The database keeps the manufacturing knowledge available to design and manufacturing personal in the same way and in the same manner. In the future more time can be invested to increase technology knowledge in the database and to optimize process plans instead of daily routine work.
These objectives will be achieved using the significant advances made by the participants in the development of a new generation of solids modeller, a highly advanced NC programme preparation system based on the solids modeller, a prototype CAPP system and sophisticated genetic algorithms.

21420;2318;EVEREST;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;European Vanguard Efforts on Research and Engineering of Systems for Testing;01/01/1989;31/12/1992;;"During the last few years, exploitation of the ever-progressing fabrication technologies has resulted in increased complexity in electronics products and hence an increase in the cost of testing them. In certain areas this testing can account for up to half the product cost. This can best be solved by treating the design and testing of the new product as part of the same problem. 

The EVEREST project aimed to provide a consistent environment for checking the testability of products while they are being designed, and for generating the data which will ensure that the designs can be verified before construction and that the fabricated parts can be easily tested for manufacturing faults.
Testing of electronics, specifically very large scale integration (VLSI) based systems, has hitherto been based on ideas and skills conceived and matured in the United States of America. However, the growing understanding of quality issues has focused attention on the need for promoting design for testability (DFT) and testing in general. Creation of a strong environment in the field of testing has been identified as a strategic necessity for Europe. The European vanguard efforts on research and engineering systems for testing (EVEREST) project is addressing this as follows:
by promoting the general use of a test specification format;
using expert systems for test purposes;
the designing and developing of tools for test generation;
establishing a general methodology applicable to DFT, self test and silicon compiler environments;
 providing a VLSI verification tester.

An automatic built in tool for machine testing has been developed. Using a system of dynamic programmable logic arrays (PLA) with complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), we have developed specific techniques of design for testability which enable breakdown lists to be obtained.

A general study of the extension of the electronic design interchange format (EDIF) to include information to describe a test of an electronic product has been carried out. A data modelling methodology has been used to develop the test specification extension, with the result that the extension is well defined and can be used for the evaluation of other test standards.
The project developed a prototype VLSI Verification Tester for mixed-signal circuits and an integrated suite of CAD tools which can help to remove the bottleneck between CAD and CAT environments. 

The most important targets were: 

- a verification tester to provide a complete design-to-test solution for VBSs 
- a CAE-ATE independent test specification format 
- knowledge-based solutions for test planning and failure diagnosis at various levels 
- tools for test generation, functional validation, test data analysis and fault simulation 
- design for testability methods for a silicon compiler environment 
- integration of all functions in a user-friendly workstation environment.";;;;;ELEKTRONIKCENTRALEN;DK;"RE TECHNOLOGY AS;SIEMENS AG;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;UNIVERSITAT DE CANTABRIA;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA;Université de Montpellier II (Université des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc);HERIE;TELEFONICA;SCANTEST SYSTEM A/S;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN;Universität Gesamthochschule Duisburg;Bull SA;Brunel University;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"DK;DE;ES;FR;IE;NL;PT;UK;BE";

The user-oriented robot programming language is treated as an interface, between the programmer and the programming system. These developments will be based on formal techniques for specifying the interfaces that are relevant for the robotic application area. In this sense, the proposed project follows the approach of ESPRIT project 322 and extends its scope into the robotics domain.

The first phase of NIRO is covered by ESPRIT II project 2614. This project covers its continuation and completion. The text relates to the whole project. 

The main aim is to develop processors, software tools and methods that will enable multivendor systems to be put together. An important topic of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by constructing prototypes to prove the inter-communication capabilities between systems built from multivendor modules. 

The development of neutral interfaces consists basically of the following steps: 

- identification of the relevant interfaces 
- identification of the information representing the functions and data for planning, programming and program execution in robotics which have to flow across the interfaces 
- formal specification of the data types and statements and their semantics and syntactical representation 
- development, testing and enhancement of processors

A definition of common standards will increasingly have a beneficial effect on the development of European competition and for meeting the needs of the networks. The evaluation of costs will be important in planning the implementation of the system.  

The European system for the management of rail traffic which includes the system of command control of rail traffic constitutes an integrated project, in which the required results depends on the execution of the project as a whole.  

For budgetary reasons, only a first phase comprising the overall design of the system, the evaluation of the location and communication tools as well as the development of the principal software components necessary for the use of the system, could be carried out under EURET.  

But it is important that the remaining phases of the project, i.e., the development of the components, the implementation of the system and its prototyping could be started at a later date or in parallel according  to the cases.  

The Commission is now moving in this direction by developing the EUROCAB, EUROBALISE and EURORADIO projects.
A through state of the art study has been carried out in which all operational automatic train control systems (ATC) were detailed from a functional point of view. From this approach was derived a first list of 60 functions to be included in the Automatic Train Control System (ATC) of European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and a first list of interfaces related to the ATC.

The primary functions of ATC or ERTMS are defined as automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO), maintenance, logging, train status and operation support.

The interfaces related to the ATC are between it and train track, driver, interlocking, maintenance, passanger, supervision and environment.
Under the agreement established between the Railways and Industry, the Community of European Railways (CER) will supply the Functional Requirements Specification and the Overall System Design Specification. It is understood that the intended timetable is:  
- Functional requirements available july 1992.  
- Information flow analysis by june 1993.  
- System design specification by august 1993.  

Contents of the project:  
The ERTMS project will define jointly with the CER the framework for the development of EUROCAB, EUROBALISE and EURORADIO. The ERTMS project and ETCS are long term programmes aimed at compatible long-term solutions.  

First of all, within task 1, the contractor will consult the CER to obtain operational and functional requirements. This will enable the definition of needs to be established and lead to functional specifications. The criteria for the analyses of the technology are derived from these requirements. The contractor will analyse existing technology and technology currently under development within Europe and abroad.  

The investigation of the location systems (task 2) and transmission methods (task 3) will lead to technical evaluation of suitable technology.  

Derived from the harmonized requirements of the definition of needs, the functional specification and the technical evaluation of a number of different system concepts may be developed. The industry group will select one or more proposals and, in liaison with the railways, will establish (a) preferred solution(s).  

Task 4 will require close integration with the other tasks 1, 2 and 3. The contractor proposes to define as far as possible the data processing architecture, the requirements of communication management and protocols, simulation and maintenance philosophies. Consideration will be given to the needs for unifying crossborder passenger information, train maintenance and diagnosis, and other related management tasks.

21676;5604;CIB;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Computer-Integrated Building;15/11/1990;14/08/1991;;"This exploratory action aims to identify the potential for integration in the organisational and management of building operations from the design and planning stage, through to occupation and demolition. The acceptability of computer-aided building to professionals and end-users will be assessed.
Since information technology (IT) is well established now as the enabler of integration in the building industry, an assessment of what IT has to offer to reach this goal was carried out. The scope of this assessment was restricted to the type of research and development in IT that shows potential to be absorbed by the building industry. First, the following areas were considered:
the present situation regarding the use of IT in the building industry;
opportunities for further use of IT;
the sole of IT in integrating the building industry;
different levels of IT support for integration in the building industry.
Then a review of current research in IT relevant to computer integrated building (CIB) was carried out. Specifically the following subjects were dealt with:
computer integrated manufacture open system architecture (CIM-OSA);
electronic data interchange (EDI);
advanced information processing;
product model standardization;
computer aided manufacturing;
computer aided design;
CIB project review.

The building sector has many specific characteristics which made it quite different from any other industrial sector and which must be understood when considering information technology (IT) as a tool for integration and productivity enhancement. Thus an assessment of the current organizational structure of the building sector was carried out, under the following loadings:
specificities of the building sector;
bearings of the specificities of the building sector on IT;
economic importance of the building sector in Europe;
main actors of the building process (client, design team, builders, installers, user, property manager, industrial producers, stockists, suppliers, distributors, machinery and plant hire firms, authorities, financing institutes);
responsibilities of these actors in the building process;
national specificities; organisation of actions in the building process;
classical fragmented organisation;
integrated organisation.
Finally, from this assessment the conclusion is drawn that an integrated building process is the solution to most of the problems that occur in a traditional building sector and that the early stages of the building process are the ones which will benefit most from integration. IT must act as a catalyst of such an integration and provide the tools required to bring it about.

The construction process involves a large number of act as (organizations, companies and individuals) each of which has a part to play in influencing, executing or controlling some element of the process. Thus a selection of viewpoints into the building process was explored in order to investigate the future requirements for comprehensive computer integrated building to become a normal method of working. First, the view points of the user and the owner were considered. Then the building life cycle was considered in terms of stages of the cycle, the information generated and the transfer of knowledge between the differnt stages. Particular attention was paid to the methods by which information technology (IT) could be used to integrate the contributions of different actors in order to improve the whole building life cycle (eg the possibility of considering maintenance costs and problems during design could potentially result in substantial maintenance cost savings).
The action will consider the results and concepts of existing ESPRIT projects to establish an integration framework for the building sector. 

Specific tasks or product life-cycles will be identified which could benefit from the use of information technology, such as planning, design, construction and maintenance. The potential for integration will be specifically examined. An open workshop will provide vital input to the action.";;;;;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;BE;"VOLMAC NEDERLAND BV;Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT;Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB);Dialogic SA;Euroexpert & Partners;PCK AND ASSOCIATES;SOGEA;Taywood Engineering Ltd";"NL;UK;FR;EL";

22139;MR41*0006;EUROHEP;;FP2-MHR 4C;;FP2;European study group on viral hepatitis;01/01/1990;31/12/1992;;"The specific aims of this European concerted action were the following: 
- to assess the natural course and outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection. 
- to construct prognostic indices of chronic hepatitis B aiming for rational application of therapeutical approaches, namely antiviral drugs and/or liver transplantation. 
- to study viral antigen expression in liver and serum and relate it to markers of the specific and general immune response in the liver and blood. 
- to perform meta-analysis on completed and ongoing clinical trials on antiviral treatment of chronic HBV infection. 
- to construct prognostic indices for treatment-induced events in chronic HBV-infection. 
- to determine the therapeutic gain in survival after liver transplantation for chronic viral hepatitis. 
- to assess the efficacy of hepatitis B immunoglobulin in the prevention of recurrence of viral hepatitis after liver transplantation.

Viral hepatitis, in particular chronic viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, is an important health problem in Europe. In the high-endemic countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal there are at least 2.5 million virus carriers; in the low-endemic countries of North-Western Europe chronic viral hepatitis predominantly affects haemophiliacs, homosexuals and drug addicts, but 30 percent of virus carriers do not belong to specific risk groups. 

Chronic viral hepatitis appears to run a variable natural course. Subjects from North and Central European countries usually become infected during adult life, often through sexual practice, have high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and core protein (HBeAg) in the serum, and after a variable number of years clear HBeAg and HBV from the serum with remission of the inflammation of the liver. In Southern Europe, intrafamilial spread is common giving rise to infection early in life. Clearance of HBeAg occurs frequently, but HBV-replication with active liver disease can persist in antiHBe-positive patients. The existence of an emerging variant strain of the virus has been demonstrated. Moreover, hepatitis D virus (HDV) superinfection is particularly common in Southern Europe both in relation to intrafamiliar spread as well as to drug addiction. Conceivably, the ongoing pandemic of human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is spreading predominantly among homosexuals in North-Europe and among drug addicts in Southern countries, might modify the epidemiological, clinical and virologic patterns of the disease. The pathobiology of chronic viraemia is only partly understood and further study of immunology, environmental factors (lifestyle, virus-virus interaction) and molecular biology could elucidate why a small proportion of infected persons develop chronic viral hepatitis. 

All types of chronic viral hepatitis are now amenable to treatment by antiviral agents or liver transplantation. Alpha-interferon is being tested widely and will be licensed in Europe. This treatment is costly and only effective in a minority of patients. Similarly, the very costly therapy of liver transplantation is increasingly applied to patients with liver failure due to chronic viral hepatitis, although the effectiveness of this treatment modality appears uncertain. The evaluation of the modification of the natural history by such treatments is impossible by the incomplete knowledge of the prognosis without treatment. Furthermore, indications for intervention should be based on both prognosis and the expected benefits of the treatment. Results of antiviral drugs and liver transplantation vary widely from centre to centre, probably related to different characteristics of the patients and variable modes of treatment. In order to restrict treatment to subgroups of patients with chronic viral hepatitis who are most likely to benefit from it, cooperative research in both assessing prognosis as well as benefits and risks of treatments is mandatory. 

In addition to the studies on epidemiology, antiviral therapy and liver transplantation, the Eurohep programme includes a section on pathobiology aiming to diffuse standardized laboratory methodology for measurement of virus or virus antigens, and to facilitate basis research on blood or tissue samples from patients in the clinical research programmes.";;;;;University Hospital Dijkzigt;NL;;;

In fact, Portuguese SMEs have not hitherto participated to any great extent to Union programmes in microelectronics. Their knowledge of such programmes was insufficient, and there was a lack of engineering skills to develop and update the new technologies. AICI aims to improve this situation by demonstrating examples of successful technology transfer. There exist numerous potential product applications for SMEs, from supplying large electronic companies to manufacturing of products for niche (but global) markets. This requires however proper technology transfer and participation in research projects. 

The AICI consortium combines different types of expertise. INESC, the co-ordinating partner, has the technological know-how and the basic services needed to set up the organisation. The Portuguese universities are represented by groups working at INESC - the Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), from Lisbon, and the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto (FEUP) - and by the University of Aveiro.

1. Evaluation of hypocaloric peripheral parenteral nutrition (HPPN) as a therapeutical instrument in the surgical patients. 
2. Definition of clinical settings in surgical patients in which this therapy is effective. 
3. Validation of biological variables at a cellular level as markers of the effect of nutritional intervention. 
4. Improvement of our biochemical knowledge of the effect of HPPN. 
5. Search of a correlation between clinical outcome and the more specialized biochemical studies proposed.

Parenteral nutrition has provided substantial benefits to critically ill patients over the last 20 years. Although some indications for parenteral nutrition are universally accepted, other situations require further study, as consistent data proving the efficacy of such treatment are lacking. On the market, there are many products related to artificial nutrition. Products approved in some EC countries are prohibited in others, and this situation facilities the eventual utilization of products in some cases lacking adequate clinical and scientific validation. 

A European research project has been set up to investigate hypocaloric peripheral parenteral nutrition (HPPN). The project, named EUROPAN, focused on the use of HPPN in surgical patients, about 50% of such patients are undernourished and nutritional support can reduce postoperative complications. The aim of HPPN is to supply amino acids to avoid deterioration due to protein breakdown, a certain amount of calories, and adequate amounts of indispensable electrolytes. Debated issues include whether lipids are useful or harmful in the stress situation and which carbohydrates should be used as alternative to glucose. To answer questions such as these, researchers need to learn more about intermediary metabolism in the stress phase.";;;;;Hospital General Princesa Sofia;ES;;;

PROOFS wanted to develop a generic technology which should be adaptable to the different application domains targeted by the project: banking (credit and bank loan authorisation), finance (electronic shopping with integrated back office) logistics (logistic support in a transport company) and telecommunication (document teleconferencing system)
The project aimed to stimulate and promote the use of formal techniques in the domain of heterogeneous distributed applications and develop a generic technology adaptable to the different application domains targeted by the project. Distributed applications are becoming more and more complex and, in consequence, their integration creates an increasing need for methods to reduce the cost of development and maintenance and to allow the reusability of components already developed.
Integration at the application level involved defining a distributed application and early validation of concepts with customers from different backgrounds and of architectures integrating communication flows between already existing heterogeneous systems and network architectures. Integration at the technical level involved use of formal methods to increase reliability, reusability and maintainability and generality, in order to factorize developements, reduce the cost of the needed environment, standardize throughout different application domains and provide a bridge between all players.

The project succeeded in chosing formal techniques adapted to different application domains and in training the development team. The following 4 pilot applications are being developed:
electronic shopping (SLIGOS);
banking (PRISMA and ENTEL);
logistics (IPL-TNO);
teleconferencing.
The methodology has been defined and the tooling work has started.
Demonstrations on real industrial application pilots were planned to assess the PROOFS developments. The development of a specific training material was also planned to allow the technology transfer towards the development teams of the specific application domains. 

The project has addressed the fact that distributed applications are becoming more and more complex. In consequence, their integration creates an increasing need for methods to reduce the cost of development and maintenance and to allow the reusability of components already developed. 

The work has been directed by the following application needs: 

- Integration at the application level: 

. defining a distributed application 
. early validation of concepts with customers from different backgrounds and of architectures integrating communication flows between already existing heterogeneous systems and network architectures.

Also consensus between the different participants involved must be reached, taking into account their respective needs.  

The AEGIS consortium is a multi-disciplinary group consisting of Academic and Industrial Institutions who have not contributed, until now, to Phare Scenario elaboration and will bring their knowledge and expertise in specific methods and techniques (for example, HMI), as well as organizations well aware of ATM problems. Some of the latter have participed in Phare programme elaboration and have been responsible for the complementarity of this programme and the consistency of the whole study.  

The objectives of the AEGIS study are: to explore new aspects of the problem, taking advantage of the multi-disciplinary origins of the group; to ensure that a common approach is adopted by all the participants, including Industries, Academics and Airlines. An outcome of this study could be the identification of additional research in areas not covered in Phare, Such as interaction between airlines and ATC or ground movement problems.
The analysis performed during critical analysis and comparison of scenarios of the AEGIS study has produced the following results:
an initial air traffic managment (ATM) description, which will evolve according to the work;
a classification of scenarios;
a list of concepts;
a first of list quality standards (for scenario assessment).
The work performed on the concepts assessment has produced the following results:
identification of concepts;
identification of assessment criteria;
list of concepts assessed.
The extent to which the objectives for the critical analysis and comparison of scenarios have been met has been evaluated. The selection of scenarios is not exhaustive and it could be argued that some national, regional or worldwide documents have been omitted. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the sample of analyzed scenarios provides an acceptable vision of the trends of evolution in the ATM situation. The comparison of scenarios provided an outline to be enriched by further work. In order to take advantage of the different expertise of the participants in the AEGIS project, a common culture has been established by introducing ATM to novice participants in particular fields of ATM.
The EURET programme identifies in its topic 1.4 a need for industrial contribution to the Phare programme for demonstration of AIR/GROUND cooperation feasibility. In this context, the PHARE scenario has been developed to shape the future ATC system. Nevertheless, the complexity of such a task requires a large amount of human effort and expertise in different technical fields.  

Moreover, enlarging the area of investigation will considerably improve and consolidate the European and International scenarios related to ATM. That is the purpose of the AEGIS programme (ATM European Group for Improvement of Scenarios).  

Up to the present, the interaction between airline operators and ATM has not been studied, except in CATMAC and only to a certain extent. AEGIS will thus make a significant contribution in this area, by adding new elements to preexisting scenarios.  

Another significant contribution will be development of general methodologies, analysis and activity models, scenario definitions, cost/benefit models and metrics which will be applicable to similar problems.  

AEGIS will gather complementary expertises and proposes the following approach:  
The 'first workpackage' will logically consist of a critical analysis and comparison of all the available scenarios.  
Nevertheless, most of these scenarios concentrate on ATM. In order to extend the area of investigation, 'workpackage 2' will be a critical analysis of the available concepts in the revelant technical fields.  

The following 'workpackage 3' will necessarily consist of a more precise definition of a scenario. The description of its main components will provide the framework used in 'workpackage 4' to consolidate a set of scenarios.  

The improvement of this set will then be conducted through 'workpackages 5 to 7' with respective consideration given to the environment field, organization field, technical requirements and transition feasibility.  

It is recognised that cost/benefit analysis is of prime importance for the evaluation of scenarios. For this reason it will be covered by 'workpackage 8'. 'Workpackage 9' will be the conclusion of the present AEGIS programme, characterized by the choice of the most promising scenario with complementary cost/benefit analysis and improvement.  

This chosen scenario will in fact only be the basis for simulations, validations or preoperational experiments preceding the detailed design and implementation of the ATM system. That is why the AEGIS programme will propose a set of complementary studies and actions defined in coordination with ongoing Phare programme developments (EFMS, CMS, etc).";;;;;INGENIERIA DE SYSTEMAS PARA LA DEFENSA DE ESPANA;ES;"Syseca SA;University of London;Sextant Avionique SA";"FR;UK";
17200;AERO0026;ODA;;FP2-AERO 0C;;FP2;Optimum design in aerodynamics;01/06/1990;31/07/1992;;"The aim of the project is to improve shape design in the aeronautical industry by developing mathematical and engineering tools using supercomputers. In situations where the numerical simulations of aircraft by computers are in current use, optimization methods provide a powerful aid to engineers to improve their designs.
Subsonic and transonic airfoil and wing optimization procedures have been developed to treat optimization problems namely drag minimization, lift maximization or target pressure recovery with possible non linear constraints to satisfy geometrical requirements and control aerodynamic characteristics in off-design conditions. The most innovative outcomes of this project concern progress accomplished in design with Euler solvers, fast one pass inverse methods for rotational flows, parametrisation of non linear surfaces, hierarchical multi level method for control variables and automatic adaptive remeshing. 

Results obtained from a workshop indicate quite large discrepancies both in design due to the quality of the flow analysis solver and the parametrisation of the shape and also in efficiency with the choice of the optimiser. These comparisons can provide useful guidelines for choosing optimization or inverse methods with inviscid potential or Euler flows. 

It is clear that access to practical 3-D applications including viscous effects in an industrial environment requires still an important effort. In particular cost effective designs of good quality achieved with the above methodologies and their associated algorithms should have to be implemented in a near future on parallel architectures.
The partners have experimented with optimum design methods in the past. Now that computers are more powerful, it is believed that systematic 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional optimization of aircraft configurations can be implemented by industry. The aim of this study is to validate this point and to develop the tools necessary for this implementation. 

The study will cover optimal design for the compressible inviscid flow equations produced by advanced numerical techniques. Particular attention will be devoted to the development of fast algorithms adapted to the problem (which usually contains several non-linear constraints), using modern minimization algorithms, to obtain reliable adaptive mesh generators when the shape of the configuration being studied is changed and to write user-friendly interactive graphic tools to monitor the generated shapes. Simple engineering methods will be also investigated as inverse problem techniques. At the end of this project, a workshop will take place to validate the developed methodologies on a few test cases including wing fuselage design, multi-airfoil design and air intake design.";;;;CSC;DASSAULT AVIATION SA;FR;"NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;Deutsche Aerospace Airbus GmbH;Alenia Aerospazio - Un'Azienda Finmeccanica SpA;Simulog Sa;Stichting Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaart Laboratorium;Numerical Consultants Ltd T/A Tritech;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA";"EL;FR;DE;IT;NL;IE;ES";

This combined study aims at: 
The improvement of the understanding of the dominant physical processes (wake-body interaction, propulsion system-wing-fuselage interaction, vortex blade-interaction, etc). 
The provision of computation codes capable of predicting reliably the load distributions on the various components of the airframe configuration.
The operation of multi-component configurations operating in strong interaction was considered. The specific configurations included a rotor mounted together with its nacelle on a wing. By inclining the rotor axis with respect to the plane of the wing different flow situations were generated that correspond to the flows developed around tilt-rotor aircrafts and helicopters. These flow situations have been investigated both numerically and experimentally giving valuable information. Among the various physical characteristics, special attention was given to the intense vortex interactions that take place between the wake of the rotor and the wing. As regards the experimental part of the work, steady and unsteady measurements were taken providing a complete data base. In particular apart from the local and global loading characteristics, three-dimensional velocity measurements as well as tracing of the top vortices of the rotor were performed. These measurements were compared with numerical predictions obtained by means of aerodynamic models of varying complexity. This evaluation task showed that reasonably accurate results can be obtained even if viscous effects are neglected.
The propeller-nacelle-wing configuration will be considered in conventional and convertible form. In the experimental part of the project, extensive wind tunnel tests will be performed including measurements of the local and global aerodynamic coefficients, 3-dimensional velocity measurements, circulation measurements on the rotor blades and vortex trajectory measurements. 

The experimental methods to be used include measurements with strain gauges, hot wires, pressure transducers and laser anemometry, as well as flow visualization techniques of various types. In the numerical part of the project, several grid-free methods of boundary element type and of varying complexity will be used. The simpler are based on the equilibrium of the propeller wake, whereas the more elaborate approximate the full unsteady non-linear equations using the vortex particle approach.";;;;CSC;NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;EL;"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);UNIVERSITE DE LA MEDITERRANEE D'AIX-MARSEILLE II;Università degli Studi di Pisa";"FR;IT";

To fulfill the above mentionned objectives, the EURATN project consists in the following:  
- the development and procurement of all the necessary components of the ATN with the exception of all subnetworks up to layer 4 of the ISO-OSI basic reference model (ISO 7498), with the exception of the real air-ground subnetworks but including the necessary interfaces for these three candidate subnetworks, that are VHF (AVPAC), satellite (SATCOM) and SSR Mode-S; this covers mainly the development of the Intermediate Systems (IS) usually called ATN routers or, in the case of commercial aircraft, Communication Management Unit, and of the end systems (ES) to be connected to an ATN demonstrator to validate the ATN concept;  
- the development and procurement of the software components, or the adaptation of the existing ones for the  upper layers (session, presentation and application) and for the initial applications to be implemented in the end systems connected to the demonstrator and for the first experiments;  
- the application of a network management standard and development of related tools to manage the experimental ATN and their integration in the demonstrator;  
- the performance of specific studies to dimension and evaluate the performances of the EURATN system elements, to elaborate a performance measurement plan to validate the previous results;  
- the integration and the performance of validation tests of all the above components; these validation tests may include flight tests with an experimental aircraft (as an option). It is expected that the required airborne equipment may be bought and implemented in the frame of an other related RTD project (e.g.PHARE), as it is the case for the commercial software and hardware required by the project;  
- the definition of a plan of experiments to completely validate and experience the ATN capabilities, to be performed in a following phase of the EURATN project;  
- the development of an EURATN Operation Manual for the CEC to provide to any organization whishing to connect its experimental facilities to the EURATN experimental network;  
- during all the phases of the project, the participants will coordinate their work to provide reports and recommendations to international bodies concerned in ATM such as EUROCONTROL, ICAO and noticeably its AMSS, SICAS panels and the FANS 2 committee, IATA and airlines industry standards organizations. Coordination will be ensured also with ongoing related RTD projects e.g. PHARE, EASIE of EUROCONTROL, and the ATN project led by MITRE Corporation in the United States.
The main European aeronautical telecommunication network (EURATN) requirements are now defined. The topology of the demonstrator has been identified and approved, as well as the telecommunication architecture and the initial applications (including network management applications). The structure of the EURATN demonstrator will allow the validation of the major concepts of the aeronautical telecommunications network (ATN). On the other hand, the selected initial applications will be a good basis for the future Programme for Harmonized Air Traffic Management Research in Eurocontrol (PHARE) experiments.

The only questions still pending relate to the mobile subnetworks access for which a solution must be quickly identified and to the interdomain routing protocol for which two solutions will be specified in parallel (full off the shelf protocol and minimum protocol developed in house).

The pilot programme has also enabled specialised techniques and facilities to be developed which will provide a sound basis for further developments in the knowledge of ice physics. 

The study of a section of an accretion can reveal some of the history behind the formation of the ice. The trajectory of the iced up structure through the air, the temperature and the icing conditions and the way these vary, all leave recognisable features in the microstructure of the ice. These features are permanent enough to enable practical recovery, storage and transportation of the ice, providing suitable conditions are maintained. 

The adhesion of ice to different materials varies significantly. The performance of a mechanical de-icer is influenced by the degree of ice adhesion, so the careful selection of surface material for de-icers will enhance their effectiveness. 

The presence of ice may be detected by dielectric means, both at very low frequencies and in the microwave domain. The sensitivity of the techniques suggests potential to detect low levels of airfoil contamination, and more localised thicker accretions. 

The use of thermal imaging techniques for ice surface temperature measurement is very practical. Lightweight equipment has the sensitivity and flexibility to provide invaluable data for heat transfer studies to improve ice accretion modelling approximations, and to help relate this to the observed structure and properties of ice. 

A basis exists for the complete design of an impulsive de-icing system with a high probability of good performance without recourse to a lengthy iterative design and testing. Considerable potential exists to engineer the structures and materials involved in electro-impulsive de-icers to obtain better performance than has been achieved to date.
CAPRI is a pilot programme comprising a number of tasks which address both fundamental and technical aspects of aircraft ice protection. 

During the initial phases of the programme, experimental and theoretical work on the mechanics and physics of ice and water will be undertaken in order to provide an improved understanding of the basics and to assess the potential of various concepts. These include microwave heating, advanced electrical, mechanical and electromechanical, ice phobic and fluid based systems. To complement this work an assessment of the ice protection requirements of aircraft of advanced aerodynamic performance will be made. 

Following the preliminary fundamental phase of the investigation 2 potential systems will be selected for development and testing. The data available at this stage of the work will ensure that the design of the 2 systems can proceed without an extended period of development. 

The 2 trial systems will be tested in an icing tunnel and their performance examined critically in the light of the theoretical and fundamental aspects involved. The consortium will, at this stage, have a consolidated understanding of the basic considerations and will be in a strong position to make further developments beyond the scope of the pilot programme.";;;;CSC;British Aerospace Defence Ltd;UK;"UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN;Aérospatiale Société Nationale Industrielle SA;Alenia Aerospazio - Un'Azienda Finmeccanica SpA;Fokker Aircraft BV;DASSAULT AVIATION SA;Lucas Aerospace Ltd;Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB);Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;University of Patras";"IE;FR;IT;NL;UK;DE;EL";

Pressure and acceleration sensors will be investigated. A demonstrating network will be assembled and evaluated providing a set of preliminary results for follow-on work.
Three prototypes of angular encoders were tested.  One of them was mounted on a compresser tested in a bench. ( by SNECMA )  The results obtained with this prototype were satisfactory.  The 3rd prototype was designed to be linked with an optical harness before the optoelectronic unit for reason of versatility.  The BERTIN laboratory tests have shown that this particular utilization has to be avoided.  This sensor must be linked to the optoelectronic unit by its own harness without any other interface.



EMI tests (conducted emission, radiated emission, conducted susceptibility, radiated susceptability) were conducted by SNECMA on the angular encoder versus an electromagnetic sensor. 



The tests on the pressure sensor ( by BERTIN and SEXTANT ) revealed its sensitivity to the fluid (air or oil) and a small operating temperature range which make it incompatible with aeronautical use. 



An accurate fibre Bragg grating wavelength readout system was manufactured with a low cost spectometer by KING'S COLLEGE.  A signal processing algorithm was necessary to achieve the high resolution.  The tests were performed on 4 multiplexed gratings fabricated on -the same fibre, by KING'S COLLEGE, DEUTSCHE AEROSPACE AIRBUS. 



The engine network was designed by BRITISH AEROSPACE, SNECMA and AEROSPATIALE to access the angular encoder and a set of multiplexed sensors (like the pressure sensor one).  A multiplexer, using the tree multiplexing techniques, was manufactured for the tests.  It was designed to be compatible with an engine core. 



The components used in this network all resist high temperature withstanding : multimode graduated index fibre, 820 nm single mode fibre, multiway single and multimode connectors, couplers, delay lines, fused splices.  The test results were stisfactory.  The fading of the optical signal due to temperature change was under 3 dB.  No incompatibily high temperature use was found on the selected components, but no ageing tests were performed.  The results on the airframe network showed that FDDI could be sued for this application.  The tests on individual components, intermediate assembly or protocol gave correct results on the whole. 

The study covers the different aspects of a sensor network and uses new concepts of intrinsic optical fibre sensors. Sensors will be defined and designed by using advanced optical fibre technology, in association with a coherence multiplexing technique and an optical reading system of interferometric type. Two stages have been defined to implement a laboratory demonstrator. The first stage will be devoted to the realization of 2 compatible lines of sensors, one for optical fibre accelerometers and one for optical fibre pressure sensors. The same type of interferometer and data processing unit will be used for each sensor. The second stage will evaluate the complete system with both lines of optical fibre sensors arranged in the same network by using a common interferometer and data processing unit. 

The programme of work consists of 8 tasks, defined as follows: 
Study of requirements and definition of specifications. 
Design of sensor heads, interferometer and processor units. 
Development and assembly of sensors and measurements rig. 
Study of aircraft system criteria for networking. 
Test refinement and reports. 
Assembly evaluation and review of system demonstrator. 
Guidelines for programme continuation. 
Studies for robotic applications. 

This project is a pilot phase for the demonstration, through a laboratory rig, of the capability of such a network to be compatible with aircraft system criteria for future development. Parameters of interest such as measurement range and accuracy, environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, vibration, etc), and also number of sensors for multiplexing, network architecture (in terms of safety, redundancy, etc), will be taken into consideration for realistic operational applications. An extension of this sensor system will be studied for robotic applications.";;;;CSC;Thomson-CSF;FR;"SMITHS AEROSPACE LTD.;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK";"UK;PT;DK";

The communications spectrum is rapidly becoming too confined to accommodate the increase in traffic unless high frequencies become available. V-sat system will move to 30 GHz, vehicle mobile communications to 63 GHz and Doppler Radar to 78 GHz. Urban short hop links are also following the same direction. 

The need is there, the limiting factor is the demand for sound, cheap hardware with reliable industrial components. At 30 GHz and above however new technologies and devices have to be developed. This is essentially the object of this project. The originality is that the devices and technology are driven by the system's requirements expressed by three of the partners in the AIMS consortium. Together with this activity to define the system needs, there is a group engaged in working on circuit optimisation and an advanced device development in the research and development of the components companies.
The communications spectrum is rapidly becoming too confined to accommodate the increase in traffic unless high frequencies become available.

At 30 GHz and above however new technologies and devices have to be developed. This is essentially the object of this project.

Together with the activity of defining the system needs, there is a group engaged in working on circuit optimization and advanced device development.

The demonstrators will be functional blocks of front ends for 2 similar communication systems at approximately 30 GHz:
a short hop land based link;
a 20/30 GHz V-SAT system.

The subassemblies acting as demonstrators will be a synthesizer for a V-SAT front end, the associated transceiver and a receiver assembly for a short hop link made of circuits developed in the course of this work.

The project has already completed the system definition of subassembly and device requirements for the V-SAT and short hop links at 30 GHz. Based on this, heterojunction devices (such as heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and pseudomorphic heterojunction field effect transistor (HFET) needed in such systems have been developed. These devices are being incorporated into subassembly circuit development to make the demonstrators needed.
The concept is to build the project in a vertical structure very applications-oriented, and bring to the market an industrial, second source facility capable of providing equipment and system houses with the mm-wave components which they need. The demonstrators will be functional blocks of front-ends for two similar communication systems at approximately 30 GHz: a short-hop land-based link, and a 20/30 GHz V-SAT system. The devices will include MESFETs (including SAGFETs), HBTs (Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors), and DMTs (Doped-Channel, MIS-like Transistors), and use will be made of the PM HFET (pseudomorphic heterojunction field-effect transistor) being developed in project 2035. The circuits will include LNAs, VCOs, T/R switches, mixers, up-converters, ADCs and power amplifiers (SSPA). The sub-assemblies acting as demonstrators will be a synthesiser for a V-SAT front-end, the associated transceiver, and a receiver assembly for a short hop link made of circuits developed in the course of this work. For these sub-assembly demonstrators a conventional version of some functions will, in a first approach, be realised with MESFET technology, which will be replaced later by the more advanced devices.";;;;;Thomson CSF;FR;"Telefunken Microelectronic GmbH;Daimler-Benz AG;Université de Lille I (Université des Sciences et Technologies de Lille Flandres Artois);Deutsche Aerospace AG;Thomson CSF Semiconducteurs Specifiques;Alcatel Espace SA;ELEKTRONIKCENTRALEN";"DE;FR;DK";

In this context, remote users are those who can only be reliably linked through long-range (HF or MF) radio systems, as they are located in remote areas away from national communications facilities or are travelling by land, sea or air.

Existing remote users employing MF and HF radio communications to access the public networks are mainly those using the maritime mobile service. The systems available are generally limited to the transmission of telephony, telegraphy and telex which, apart from telex, are operated manually, requiring operators at coast stations to connect calls to and from the public networks. Such users may alternatively employ mobile satellite communication systems (such as INMARSAT), which provide automatic access to numerous radio communications services including data and facsimile. 

The project consists of four main areas: 

- Specification of remote user and system interfaces to allow fully automatic two-way access between remote users and the public network for long-range radio. 

- Definition and development of a remote user system that will register a link request and automatically set up a link with the required network user. The process used for setting up the link will use predefined information about the intended network user's location and facilities to select the path, and will also select the frequency and data bit-rate to use. 

- Definition and development of a public network gateway that will detect and route calls from remote users to the required network user and set up a link with the required remote user. The setting up of a link to the remote user will require prior knowledge of that user's facilities, location and monitoring or some means of acquiring this information. 

- Development of new techniques to enhance and optimise the performance of data communications over long-range HF radio links. This involves investigating techniques to provide real-time channel evaluation and computation of optimum transmission parameters such as bit-rate.";;;;;SAIT ELECTRONICS SA;BE;"UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE MADRID;British Telecom plc (BT);UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA";"ES;UK";

By selective bleaching of colourants, and by foaming of the polymer, both multicolouring and white on a dark background were obtained. It also became clear that high-intensity irradiation and short pulse lengths are favourable for high bleaching efficiencies. This can be achieved using either the laser energy or the wavelength as a parameter. Note that a laser with tunable wavelength gives the broadest range of possibilities. One always has to optimise the mixture of additives to the desired background colour and to demand range of colours originating from the laser action. 

2. Laser-induced colouring on a light background 

Two routes were investigated: 

First, thermally induced mobility of colourless chemicals which can get several colours after recombination were synthesised. The feasibility of this system was proven, and resulted in a patent application. A drawback is that these chemicals do not survive the temperature of the plastic moulding-process. After further development, such a system can only be used for lacquers. 

Second, photo-induced (UV) colour-forming chemicals were synthesised. Their feasibility was proven both in lacquers (PMMA) and plastics (ABS) for a few colours. The colours were induced using UV Excimer lasers. A problem with these UV-sensitive additives is their UV light-stability. This particular needs more research. 

3. Laser System 

A prototype laser system for laser-induced colouring was developed. The system is a diode-pumping YAG laser with a second harmonic generation crystal, so the wavelength is green visible light. The laser pulses are relatively short, and have rather high energy, yielding, in principle, high quality decorations and a short processing time. The resonator design of the laser system has to be optimised to achieve a better pulse-to-pulse stability, which directly influences the quality of the decoration. 

4. Conclusions 

The plastics and lacquers showing the effects described can be developed on customer demand, because the mechanism is understood, and the behaviour of a wide range of pigments and additives is known.";;;;;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPSBEDRIJVEN;NL;"DSM;CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF LEUVEN;Haas Laser GmbH";"NL;BE;DE";

The objective of the project is to develop generic tools, techniques and methodologies for constructing and maintaining front ends (FEs), possibly knowledge based (KBFEs), to existing software.

The technology developed within the project is much more widely applicable than originally envisaged. The resulting architecture and toolkits provide a framework which offeres 3 distinct but related advantages for exisiting software: enhanced user interfaces can be added, several exisitng software components can be integrated (encapsulated) within the framework, and cooperative assistance to end users can be provided by the addition of knowledge based modules. The technology provides an environment for the development of modular, portable and, if appropriate, distributed applications.
The architecture is well reported and is recognized as an advance in this area. The range of tools being developed are now being driven by the needs of the real world KBFEs being developed. A follow on subsidiary project to bring the tools to a comprehensive industrial strength, in anticipation of full scale exploitation is now underway.There have been a significant number of KBFEs developed during the project, several of which are bein developed into industrial systems for internal or external exploitation.
Work has been undertaken to identify and clarify the work of users and system developers and to establish criteria by which each activity may be judged.
In broad terms, the approach taken by FOCUS consisted of three phases: 

- State-of-the-art KBFEs were studied and various investigations undertaken to define and generate an initial generalised architecture with associated tools, techniques and methodologies. 
- Some 'first generation' KBFEs were developed to validate the principles of the architecture and provide feedback to the tool developers. 
- A new set of tools was defined and developed based more on user (KBFE developer) requirements. These tools were applied to more advanced KBFEs with particular reference to the perceived, potential marketplaces.

At the same time, the total design time and design effort would be reduced by an order of magnitude.
The goal of interactive silicon compilation for high performance integrated systems (SPRITE) is to develop a computer aided design (CAD) system for the interactive synthesis of the complex systems required in applications such as image processing, graphics processing, radar, digital television, office automation, mobile radio, etc.

The goal of this project is to develop a computer aided design (CAD) environment for the interactive synthesis of complex integrated systems as required for the realization of real time information processing subsystems.

The initial part of the project involved the definition of the architectural styles and the definition of a new language/data structure, the sprite input language (SIL). SIL was released into the public domain to facilitate the setting of standards in the field of high level synthesis. In addition, the consortium has been involved in the SILAGE/DFL standardization committees that have standardized SILAGE/DFL as a system specification language for digital signal processing (DSP) systems. 3 prototype compilers have been developed that will be released for evaluation in key application areas. A full suite of high level compilers and a set of synthesis environments, such as CATHEDRAL, PHIDEO and CHESS, will be targeting several market niches.
Other technologies developed within the project, such as the datapath compiler CHOPIN and the timing analysis system SLOCOP, have proven useful in current industrial application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) development. In addition CHOPIN received the Flanders Technology Award for achievement in 1991.
The project also defined and implemented a synthesis tools framework and common data structure which allows the transfer of tools between the participants. Other tools to assist in the transfer of technology between partners have also been implemented: a layout procedural interface (LPI), and a high speed data interchange mechanism (SPOOK) that allow real time program to program communications via procedural interfaces.
The behavioural system specifications were described in a mixed functional/procedural language (e.g. VHDL, SILAGE). The synthesis system compiles the specifications in a chip layout using a mixture of knowledge-based and algorithmic techniques. It is oriented towards a set of generic high throughput target architectures with a variable degree of microcode programmability and parallelism. The underlying formalised knowledge base is extracted from the design of industrial demonstrator chips. 

Interactivity was based on a pragma concept. Without changing the behavioural specification at the top level, the designer can give structural 'hints' to the compilers at different hierarchical design levels. This allows the designer to explore trade-offs in terms of quality factors, such as power and area, for a required throughput as a function of the architectural choice. It also determines hardware, firmware and software trade-offs.

1. to deposit diamond and silicon carbide thin films using a range of CVD technologies; 

2. to use advanced manufacturing techniques to process the diamond and silicon carbide films, e.g. using plasmas and ion beams; 
3. to fabricate prototype, advanced sensing structures in the carbide thin films. 
Diamond films have been deposited using thermal filament and microwave chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technologies. Deposition onto substrates up to 50 mm in diameter has been demonstrated.
In addition multilayer films have been grown of undoped and doped films using boron precursor gases as the dopant carrier. Selected area deposition of the films has also been demonstrated, especially in diamond technology. These results demonstrate that it is sensible to consider the fabrication of sensing structures of doped films.
Downstream processing of the films has demonstrated that it is possible to reactive ion beam etch the structures required to give a very high quality structure definition. Metal contacts to the films have also been formed in order to make an initial assessment of the electrical properties of the as deposited and subsequently machined materials.

The performances of the films at high temperatures is under investigation. Laser Raman, resistivity, capacitance and X-ray measurements have all been undertaken at elevated temperatures. Depending on the technique being used, temperatures up to 850 C have been used to collect data. The results, thus far, indicate that the films are of high quality. There is evidence to suggest that the properties of the films are affected by temperature. However, above a minimum temperature of approximately 350 C, the properties remain stable and reproducible. There is evidence to suggest that this stability is connected with the movement of minority species, such as hydrogen, within the films.";;;;;Not Available;;"CSEM;IMEC;Howden Wade Ltd;AEA Technology plc;CENTRONICS;EPICHEM;Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB);Technische Universität Berlin;British Aerospace plc";"CH;BE;UK";

The main objective of the research was to set up pilot schemes using videotelephony to try out support services for elderly, deaf, hard of hearing, visually impaired and mobility impaired people and to demonstrate the types of support services in the care sector that would be commercially viable using videotelephony. The requirements of elderly and disabled users and their service providers were identified. These requirements were further refined to fit the scope set by the technical and resource constraints of the project. The viability of each support service was confirmed and the generic evaluation criteria for assessing the pilots established.

The project begun 6 individual pilot schemes, each of which has proved to be a remarkable success. Early results in general show that:
the demand for the support service applications demonstrated exceeds that offered by the pilots;
there are substantial benefits in using videotelephony as a means of providing support services for elderly and disabled people;
videotelephony is attractive to both users and service providers;
the financial viability of the pilot services appears to be well established as the actual cost of videotelephony support services is minimal compared to that of occasional or permanent attachment to care institutions, or the provision of care by direct intervention on a regular basis;
the support service applications for deaf and hard of hearing people are effective for communication in the work place and allow enormous savings in time and effort in the conduct of business;
the support service applications implemented in the pilots address a real need and there is market for these IBC services.
Technical Approach  

The requirements of elderly and disabled users and their service providers were identified.  These requirements were further refined to fit the scope set by the technical and resource constraints of the project. The viability of each support service was confirmed and the generic evaluation criteria for assessing the pilots established.  

The prototypes of the modified videophones, service desk and a simulated broadband networks were produced and trials run to finalise the operational requirements (users, service centre and PTT) of the pilots, and the equipment specifications for the manufacturers and suppliers.  

For all pilots the engineering, production and installation of the terminals, centre equipment, the software, networks, training and operational documentation for each of the pilot sites was completed.  

Operation of the first pilot site started in June 1989 (Kuusamo) and the last will start will start in January 1992 in Rotterdam.  Monitoring of the appeal and usability of each service and usage of the pilots is being performed in accordance with the evaluation procedures set-up earlier.  This is to be fed back to the Commission via a common report for all the pilots, a project review and as recommendations to RACE and the standards bodies.  

Key Issues  
Social services are growing in importance and scale. Currently these are often realised through frequent daily visits or by transferring the person to a residential place of care.  

One of the key issues for the successful introduction of new services is usability.  This means trying to understand both the client and service users' needs and expectations from a service, and producing equipment ergonomically suited to meet these needs.  

Achievements  
The project has begun 6 individual pilot schemes, each of which have proved to be a remarkable success.  Early results in general show that:  

. The demand for the support service applications demonstrated by the project exceeds that offered by the pilots.  In most cases, the service provider is keen to maintain operation beyond the planned duration of the pilot.  Some wish it to be made permanent.  
. There are substantial benefits in using videotelephony as a means of providing support services for elderly and disabled people.  
. Videotelephony is attractive to both users and service providers.  It matches and exceeds their expectations of such services, and is easy to use. Service providers are able to make good social contact and develop appropriate client-servicer relationships to support care provision and are confident of their ability to provide support and care by videotelephony.  
. That the financial viability of the pilot services appears to be well established as the actual cost of videotelephony support services is minimal compared to that of occasional or permanent attachment to care institutions, or the provision of care by direct intervention on a regular basis.  
. That the support service applications for deaf and hard of hearing people are effective for communication in the work place and allow enormous savings in time and effort in the conduct of business, and a substantial increase in the freedom of deaf people to conduct business affairs in a normal manner.  
. The support service applications implemented in the pilots address a real need and that there is market for these IBC services.  These new applications based on video-telephony services offers great opportunities for IBC,  

Based on its results, the project has published 29 papers and made two contributions to ETSI.  One of the project partners is also using the project's prototype ISDN videophones for its own experimental research.  

Expected Impact  
The providers of social services will be made aware of the role that telecommunications can play in providing more and better assistance to people with special needs in Europe.  The project should itself work to promote equipment standards that are well suited to applications supporting people with special needs.";;;;;Alcatel SEL AG;DE;"EMPIRICA GESELLSCHAFT FUER KOMMUNIKATIONS- UND TECHNOLOGIEFORSCHUNG MBH;PTT Netherlands Research;VTT TECHNICAL RESEARCH CENTRE OF FINLAND;Swedish Telecom;CET / CTT - Centro de Estudos de Telecomunicaces;Swedish Handicap Institute;University College London;Nassauisches Heim Siedlungsbaugesellschaft mbH;Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa (FMH);provincia di Torino;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA (CSELT);ROBERT BOSCH GMBH";"DE;NL;FI;SE;PT;UK;IT";

It achieved this objective by creating a common architectural approach and a system-level, object oriented architecture for service software; included in this architectural framework were both the control and management aspects associated with telecommunications software.

Technical Summary  

During 1989, the project demonstrated the feasibility of creating an open services architecture and its supporting infrastructure for the IBC.  The ROSA architecture was defined using an object-oriented paradigm (model).  An object encapsulates data, processing and communication.  The behaviour and structure of an object is described by its type using a formal specification language.  The boundaries of the objects are opaque and only the services provided are visible to other objects.  Objects interact by synchronously exchanging messages.  Distinct instances of ROSA objects operate concurrently and can be distributed.  

Objects were classified into three categories: the Service Specification Framework (SSF), the Object Support Environment (OSE) and the Fundamental Object Mechanics (FOM).  Objects in the SSF provide a pool of generic, telecom-oriented objects such as call handling and user agents.  The OSE consists of entities that provide support for computation with objects in a distributed environment.  The FOM is a set of primitives that are not subject to further object- oriented decomposition within the framework of the architecture.  

ROSA has addressed the architectural problems associated with the management of real physical entities in an IBC telecommunications environment. This has resulted in service management being an integral part of any service specification.  

Outline requirements for tool support were identified, to enable the realisation of services defined using the ROSA architecture.  How such services may be specified by their behavioural and constructional properties can be determined by formal models and transformed into an abstract target language suitable for multi-vendor implementation.  

The successful provision of open services in IBC will depend critically upon the integration of three service specification perspectives into the overall ROSA architectural framework.

The European Artic stratospheric ozone experiment (EASOE) will take place between November 1991 and March 1992.  A variety of physical and chemical measurements of the northern hemisphere lower stratosphere will be made from the ground, from large and small balloons and from aircraft.  Supporting theoretical analyses will be carried out. 

During EASOE the following tasks will be accomplished. 
Ozone concentration profiles will be measured using ozone sondes at 18 sites. 
Ground based measurements will be made especially for EASOE at 20 northern hemisphere sites.  Measurements will include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen nitrate, bromine oxide, chlorine oxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, temperature and polar stratospheric clouds. 
It is planned to launch 39 stratospheric balloons from ESRANGE, Kiruna.  These will carry scientific payloads to monitor the lower stratosphere making measurements of many chemical constitutents (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen chloride, bromine oxide, chlorine oxide, water, methane, etc) as well as of temperature and polar stratospheric clouds. 

All data obtained during the operational phase of EASOE (1 November 1991 until 31 March 1992) will be reported to the EASOE data centre at Nilu in Norway in preliminary form.

18053;STEP0050;ECOTREE;;FP2-STEP;;FP2;Water stress, xylem dysfunctions and dieback mechanisms in European oak trees;01/04/1991;31/01/1994;;"The general objective is to understand the recurrent dieback of oak forests in Europe.

European oaks suffer from recurrent dieback, which often appear after periods of summer drought. These periods of decline could be promoted by an interaction between xylem dysfunctions like cavitation and embolism, and pathogen attacks by Ophiostoma species for Quercus robur and Quercus petraea and Hypoxylon mediterraneum for Quercus cerris. The project will therefore develop an experimental analysis of these possible interactions. 

A first general objective is to quantify the susceptibility of oak trees from different species differing by their overall drought resistance to cavitation and embolism when submitted to an experimentally controlled drought. A second one will be to test the infectivity of Ophiostoma and Hypoxilon mediterraneum on potted saplings. A third objective will be to investigate interactions between water stress effects and pathogens. 

Susceptibility of oak trees to cavitation and embolism will be quantified in 2 experimental field plots, one located at Champenoux, near Nancy, France (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea), the second one near Viterbo, Italy (Quercus robur, Quercus ilex and Quercus ceris). In addition, young potted saplings will be used by all participating teams. Consequences of the losses of hydraulic conductivity on leaf physiology will be measured. Cavitation will be monitored by means of ultra sound sonors which detect acoustic events in vivo in branches. Consequences of cavitation (ie loss of hydraulic conductivity) will be measured from in vitro water flow versus applied pressures. Sap flow in trunks will be monitored with a constant heated sensor, and with the heat pulse technique. Other important parameters will be studied: wood anatomy (electron microscopy); water potential (pressure chamber or dew point hygrometers); leaf conductance (porometers); leaf photosynthesis (gas exchange chambers and chlorophyll fluoromet r), mineral elements in xylem sap and leaves (inductively coupled plasma(ICP)); and amino acids and abscisic acid in xylem sap (high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) and glow discharge mass spectrometry(GDMS)). 

Infectivity of both pathogens will be tested on potted saplings of the different species at Nancy (Quercus robur with Ophiostoma), and Viterbo (Quercus cerris, Quercus robur and Quercus ilex with Hypoxylon). The development of Hypoxylon will also be followed in a natural stand near Viterbo. Observations will include anatomical studies of disease development, and infectivity tests. Interactions of water stress with infectivity will be tested on both pathogens, in potted plants at Nancy, and on both potted plants and field trees at Viterbo. Potted trees will be submitted to controlled water shortage. Techniques include inoculation, anatomical studies of disease development, determination of tree water relations (water potential and transpiration), and measurement of hydraulic conductivities.";;;;CSC;Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA);FR;"Horticulture Research International;UNIVERSITAET BAYREUTH;UNIVERSIT DEGLI STUDI DELLA TUSCIA";"UK;DE;IT";

The transition from open water to 100% ice covered water was abrupt. The sea ice had a very sharp edge, from 0 to 100% coverage with broken ice (floes of a few metres in thickness) within a few 100 m. This suggested that it was an icefield that had drifted already for a long time. The general flow direction of this ice field was north east east (60 degrees). It drifted with a velocity of 0.12 ms{-1}. Current meters moored south of Elephant Island showed the same direction and velocity. During the entire investigation period the sea ice had no influence on the water column below. This became evident by looking at the isolines of physical and chemical parameters which were often perpendicular to teh ice edge. 3 different water masses were found at the surface in the investigation area. The stability. Maximum concentrations (in average 1.56 mg chlorophyll a m{-3} in the surface) were found at stations 49 to 63 which were located in summer modified surface water of the Weddell Sea.

A series of workshops were set up under the European Polarstern Study (EPOS) in which the following meteorological, hydrographical and nutrient results were discussed.

Between Elephant Island and the South Orkneys, wind directions along theice edge changed from north east through north, north west to south west in the period from December 29 to January 13; winds from west and north west prevailed. Average wind speed was 3 to 7.6 ms{-1}. Between 60 degrees to 61 degrees south at the ice edge, wind direction changed from 225 degrees to 270 degrees with wind speeds ranging from 4.6 to 7.6 ms{-1}. At the latitudes 48 degrees to 51 degrees south ('Polarstern') wind directions were 300 degrees to 240 degrees and wind speeds were 10 to 14.4 ms{-1}. These differences in wind speeds at the different latitudes south may have been the main cause of anticyclonic eddies at the ice edge.

Comparison of the nitrate and silicate data collected by Dr Francisco Gomez Figueiras and coworkers, Institute de Investigacion Marinas, 36208, Vigo, Spain with those collected during EPOS for this region showed that the data compared quite well.
Preliminary results indicate that at about 52 degrees west a watermass with high salinity, high nitrate and high silicate was flowing northward and later eastward. This could very well explain the variations in chemical parameters that were encountered at 49 degrees west.

A series of workshops were set up under the European Polarstern Study (EPOS) in which the following data on phytoplankton and zooplankton were discussed.

Different regional and seasonal distribution patterns of major phytoplankton groups were found. The investigation period from November to January covered the main growth season, spring and summer, for Antarctic phytoplankton. Factors influencing the different patterns found were the different water masses in the investigation area as well as the receding ice edge. Bottom topography, the shelf of the South Orkney Islands may also have influenced phytoplankton distribution either due to a different movement of water masses induced by a shallower bottom and/or due to an Islands effect itself. In general highest biomass was found in the waters of the Weddell-Scotia-Confluence int he marginal ice zone. The studies revealed 2 assemblages, one in the north dominated by diatoms in spring and another one in the south dominated by Cyptomonas species in summer.

During EPOS Leg 1 a phytoplankton bloom was found in early November in the area of the outer marginal ice zone in waters of the Weddell-Scotia-Confluence. The phytoplankton biomass was dominated by diatoms such as Thalassiosira 'gravida' forming large colonies and small Chaetoceros species mainly C neglectum. Very low abundances of phytoplankton were observed in the water column under the pack ice in the southernmost stations. This assemblage consisted mainly of nanoflagellates and pennate diatoms (Nitzschia cylindrus, other pennate diatoms). A lot of empty diatoms frustules were found. During EPOS leg 2 along a transect at 49 degrees west, the diatom bloom consisting of almost the same dominant species continued until the end of November. However, in January in the north another bloom of diatoms was found dominated by cylindrus. This dominance remained until EPOS leg 3 in late January, numbers decreased towards the south. In early January in the south (Polish da ta) cylindrus dominated near ice edge with numbers decreasing towards the open waters. This suggested 2 sources of N cylindrus, 1 in the oceanic waters in the north, another being an inoculum from the melting pack ice which contained at that time N cylindrus as the dominant species. In December and January along transect 47 degrees west and 49 degrees west (combined 'Polarstern' and 'Siedledki' data) a completely different phytoplankton assemblage was encountered dominated by cryptophytes Cryptomonas assemblage was encountered dominated by cryptophytes Cryptomonas species and diatoms decreased in numbers. Cryptomonas species increased from Elephant Island towards the South Orkneys.
Some species such as Corethorn criophilum for instance showed a distinct pattern throughout the entire investigation. A patch of this species was always related to the maximum diatom occurrence dominated by Thalassiosira 'gravida' and C neglectum. Another maximum of this species appeared in the southwest of the South Orkneys.

Polish zooplankton results (Professor Siedleck) correspond to the EPOS zooplankton results (clusters) from the Weddell Sea both with regard to species composition and to quantity. These similarities are mainly noticeable for the group Calanoida. In the case of Cyclopoida (Oithona), the Polish counts are lower than those obtained during EEPOS. This difference could be attributed to the different nets used.

A series of workshops were set up under the European Polarstern Study (EPOS) in which the following data on krill were discussed.

Netcatches and acoustic data were compared in order to calibrate and match trends and patterns found. Both acoustic data sets match very well. Swarms parameters (ie length and thickness) show the same frequency distributions with only a minor shift that is either due to differences in gainsetting of the sounders or to the fact that different areas were covered. The trend that swarm sizes increase in size and time and distance from the ice edge (towards the north) occurs in both data sets. EPOS data show that further northward sizes decrease again. EPOS data also show that in time a similar trend exists: number of swarms decrease with time while their sizes increase, while during the last transect there is again a decrease in size.
The fact that in EPOS data no diel patterns were found can be related to the mixed structure of the krill populations (small and large ones occurred in most of the stations where krill catches were made). The Polish data show that different behaviour and diel distribution are related to differences in size and life stages. This could not be confirmed by the EPOS data set as the few stations where 'unipeaked' size frequencies were found did not have matching acoustic sets. Despite the small differences in space and time in general netcatch data and distributions of krill seem to agree between the 2 expeditions. During EPOS leg 1 (end of October beginning of November) only small sized krill were found in the southern part of the area studies. In the beginning of EPOS leg 2 (end of November and December) there were still small krill near the ice edge, while bigger ones occurred in the north in the confluence area. Later during leg 2 both in the north. When comparing this with the Polish data set (end of December) we see that there are extensive stocks of large krill in the western part of the transect, near Ele phant Island, and in the Eastern part of the South Orkney Islands with the smaller ones in the centre. This may explain why near the end of EPOS leg 2 larger krill appeared near the ice as they probably drifted in from the west with the east flowing currents. So the 2 factors play a role here: passive drifting krill with the currents and active migration (in general towards the north) in search for food.

One objective of EPOS 3 was to investigate the biological, physical and chemical characteristics of the high Antarctic water column during summer. Transects were sampled to obtain quantitative profiles of the major oceanographic parameters. The long on continuous daylight is a marked feature of high Antarctic environment during the summer and it might be assumed that there would be little variability among parameters mediated by light. However it was considered as important to address this question and investigate whether short term variability was significant.

Results showed that there was marked variability in many of the physical, chemical and biological parameters in the water column over a 24h cycle. The greatest amplitude in variability was found in the upper strata of the water column and many of the parameters measured had distribution patterns that conformed with a diurnal cycle. Such patterns were not necessarily directly synchronized with the irradiance curve. Modification of the temperature profile conformed directly with the diurnal irradiance cycle and so this introduces an alternative interpretation for the diurnal changes that were observed. It was concluded that the results obtained were the combined result of diurnal biogenic effects and sampling across a small eddy in the East Wind Drift.

It was also concluded that the experiment had achieved its original objective and demonstrated marked variability among components of the pelagic marine ecosystem in the high Antarctic during summer. These observations suggested that comparisons of oceanographic data collected without replication and without regard to diurnal processes should be treated with caution. The magnitude in variation attributed to geography or seasonal time scales may actually lie within the range occurring over diurnal time scales.
The European 'Polarstern' Study (EPOS) is a co-operative European venture to investigate the ecology of plankton, benthos and sea ice communities of the Weddell Sea and adjacent regions. The expedition will be carried out during the austral summer 1988/89 on the research icebreaker Polarstern which is being put at the disposal of the scientific community of Europe by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven, F.R.G. Well over hundred scientists from eight EEC countries, three further European countries and Israel will participate in the scientific programme, which will be divises into three legs and last from October 1988 to March 1989. More than two additional years will be necessary for the work-up of cruise results, review and publication activities to be completed.";;;;CSC;EUROPEAN SCIENCE FOUNDATION;FR;ALFRED WEGENER INSTITUTE FOR POLAR AND MARINE RESEARCH;DE;

The 'TELEMAN 14 - TALOS'  project was to develop and test new concepts  for locomotion devices to be used for future intervention robots. Existing nuclear robots are limited to very simple missions of inspection and sample collection in cases of major accidents. The extension of these missions to more complex operations such as decontamination, maintenance, etc, requires large increases in volume and mass of robot payloads. Locomotion concepts and technologies were to be redesigned to combine these requirements with the severe geometrical constraints of nuclear facilities. 
New concepts for locomotion devices have been developed and tested for use in future intervention robots. 
The research has achieved the following results: 
demonstration of the train like vehicle concept for moving in a very cluttered environment, climbing stairs, and having a high specific payload carrying capacity in terms of mass and volume compared to a monobody vehicle of the same performance; 
validation of the mechanical design of the linkage mechanism between the body modules, with the incorporation of an additional active steering axis for stability; 
development and comparative testing of wheels and tracks with extendable claws and active tripod wheel undercarriages and selection of the tripod design because of its nonslip performance while climbing and descending stairs. 

To demonstrate feasibility, a prototype with 2 actively linked body modules was designed and built. The multibody vehicle with active linkages has proven itself able to follow complex trajectories in follow the leader mode even on narrow corridors or stairs. Each module remains upright during negotiation of stairs, ramps, and high obstacles.
Exploitation
The concept has been partly protected by a CEA patent. Because of its ease of control by human operators, the tripod whell undercarriage design shows the strongest potential for exploitation, while the tracked locomotion system with extendable claws is more suited to short range inspection in highly obstructed environments under direct tele-operated control. The results of the project will be exploited through further development and integration of a four module vehicle for industrial testing in the TELEMAN TM50 - MESSINA robust intervention research machine project.
Work to be done  

'TELEMAN 14 - TALOS'  was to deal with two major aspects of the mechanical engineering of locomotion devices.  The first one was the proof of the principle of multibody articulated vehicles suited to the real geometrical constraints within a nuclear facility. Emphasis was to be laid on the optimisation of the design of an articulated link and the associated tests. The articulation was to be active rather than passive in order to make the two linked cylindrical modules follow the same trajectory. Tests of a full scale mock-up were to be performed on a flat cluttered floor with corridors and   chicanes and on stairs and oblique slopes. Extension to a vehicle with three or four modules was also to be considered.  The second aspect was to be the proof of the principle of safer and more efficient devices for over-iding obstacles. Conventional wheels or  tracks were to be equipped with extensible claws and a full scale mock-up was to be manufactured according to relevant criteria (simplicity, decontamination, eff ciency in different configurations and for different kinds of obstacles such as stairs, small walls, ladders, air-locks, etc).

The main objective of the ' TELEMAN 2 - LAST CHESS PAWN' project was to build a  3D sensor for remote operation in hazardous environments. The  technology, based upon range finding information correlated with a computer slaved 2D camera, was to allow real time operation by reducing the computing time. Associated tools, such as slaved illumination, zoom and iris control were to  improve environment identification by adjusting picture quality under operator command in this project and later by computer. 
A hybrid perception system has been developed which is based on charge coupled device (CCD) and range cameras, for remote inspection within hazardous environments over a range of 1 to 25 m. The incorporation of certain automatic functions during the acquisition process (eg autofocus, autoiris and autointegration time) together with overlapping CCD and range sampling to simplify the operator's inspection task.

The CCD camera and range camera have functional characteristics that place them at the forefront of current technology. The design and realisation of the man machine interface sets the pace for future operator consoles. The range camera has already been demonstrated in nuclear power plant and the data acquired are being used to develop 3-dimensional world modelling software.
Exploitation
L.H.Conseil (France) has extended the work done for EDF in this project on the cumputerised control of the CCD camera by producing prototype that offers improved CCD integration-time control. Bertin is preparing the commercialisation of the laser range camera, and a complementary military version is under study. Building blocks developed in this project are being exploited through development and integration into the TELEMAN TM45 - IMPACT light inspection robot research machine project.
Work to be done  

The 'TELEMAN 2-LAST CHESS PAWN' development was to consist of reconfiguration  and integration into a radiation-hardened housing of the following subsystems:     

-two multiplexed range finders (long and short range)    
-variable window scanning system    
-slaved illumination, zoom, iris    
-slaved 2D camera    

Associated work on pattern recognition, definition of the physical  environment for the 3D camera and database organisation was to be done in parallel.

The aim of the project is to investigate fundamental principles and to modify well known processing steps and to make it possible to use reinforcing fibres in lengths of approximately 10 mm for polymer matrices in injection and blow moulding. Fundamentally the breakage of fibres in polymeric compounds has been investigated in capillaries, dies and couette flow as a function of processing and compounding parameters. The behaviour of fibres in a couette flow has been visualised using fluorescent fibres in transparent model fluids. Using these results, properties of the compound, design of the injection moulding machine and processing conditions have to be optimised in order to reduce fibre breakage. For thermoplastics, fibre melt impregnation and the directly following moulding step in the same heat has been one main activity. Several machines were tested and compared for their suitability. The best results (6-7 mm average fibre length) were achieved with a z-kneader. An automated method to determine fibre length and orientation has been developed. After elaboration of a specimen preparation technique and a measuring device, using an image processing system, fibres of up to 25 mm, even crossed or curved, can be detected and measured.

Research was carried out in order to investigate fundamental principles and to modify well known processing steps for the volume production of (glass) fibre reinforced composite components with long fibres (in the magnitude of 10 nm) in the final component. 

Some fundamental investigations into flows occurring during the process and into different influences on fibre attrition were undertaken. The fundamental investigations were performed using experiment capillaries, dies and a melt couette apparatus. 
Since knowledge of the length distribution of fibres in fibre reinforced plastics is of decisive importance, a computer assisted automated fibre length measurement system was developed. Fibres with lengths up to 25 mm can be detected and measured by means of an image analysis system, even when they are crossed or curved. 

Looking at the extrusion blow moulding process for the production of technical hollow articles with long glass fibre reinforced thermoplastics, different ways of fibre impregnation were investigated. Knowing that most of the fibre attrition takes place in the melting step of the polymer, a process was looked for to compound the fibres with the already molten matrix. After testing and comparing different machines a sigma or Z-shaped blade kneader proved to offer the best results. This mixer was integrated into a standard blow moulding machine. With the machine configuration average fibre lengths of above 7 mm in the final component could be reached. 

A new concept for a melting binder compound was developed. The glass fibres are protected against fibre breakage by keeping them together with a melting binder. The processing temperature is not raised above the melting point of the binder until the last zone has been reached, so that the fibre bundle dispersion and start of the fibre attrition is delayed until then.
Fundamentally the breakage of fibres in polymeric compounds has been investigated in capillaries, dies and couette flow as a function of processing and compounding parameters. The behaviour of fibres in a couette flow has been visualised using florescent fibres in transparent model fluids. Using these results, properties of the compound, design of the injection moulding machine and processing conditions have to be optimised in order to reduce fibre-breakage.  
For thermoplastics, fibre melt-impregnation and the directly following moulding step in the same heat has been one main activity. Several machines were tested and compared for their suitability. The best results (12-13mm av. fibre length) were achieved with a z-kneader. Combination of this kneader with a blow-moulding device will be investigated next. An automated method to determine fibre length and orientation has been developed.  
After elaboration of a specimen preparation technique and a measuring device, using an image processing system, fibres of up to 25mm, crossed or curved, can be detected and measured.

The device was to have special capabilities for negotiating obstacles such as stairs, doorways , etc, and for moving about in cluttered areas of nuclear buildings, where the environmental conditions could combine limited doses of radiation, with heat and other factors.
An advanced robotic device is being developed which incorporates new technologies to perform maintenance tasks such as inspection in nuclear environments too hazardous for human intervention. 
The legged robot (SHERPA) has been tested successfully under realistic conditions at 2 nonoperational nuclear power plants. The main results from the research are: 
development of an efficient semiautonomous alternating tripod gait (3 legs move at a time, 3 are stationary), to reduce power requirements; 
good operator interface such that inexperienced operators soon learn to control the robot (an on board computer controls full coordination of feet trajectories, including reflex actions); 
ability to reduce the width of the stance of the robot for narrow openings and it can also step over significant obstacles, climb and descend stairs, rotate, translate and change its overall height; 
on board batteries provide power for around 1.5 h operation; 
development of a tactile foot with collision and tilt detection and the ability to verify the soundness of the standing surface; 
algorithms for position correction, ground clearance and balance such that the load platform (300 kg load) remains horizontal; 
development of a specialized test facility to develop the optimum leg decision.
Exploitation
Further tests are underway to define regions where only such a legged machine can operate. These can include many non-nuclear situations, and involve both routine operations (where the floor is not adequate for wheeled/tracked robots) and various accident scenarios.
Work to be done  

This project was to cover the legged locomotion sub-system for carrying heavy loads in the environment described above. The originality of the project was to lie in the legged robot's mobility and agility on rough grounds and its greater ability to surmount obstacles, compared with classical wheeled or tracked robots. Improvements to the autonomous behaviour of an existing legged robot were to concern the elimination of the data links and power supply umbilical. To this effect, the robot on-board intelligence was to be  expanded by focusing on the development of reflex actions to cope with obstacles. Similarly, power consumption especially for climbing obstacles was to be minimised, through re-analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of the locomotion mechanism, following simulation studies and prototype modelling of this and other legged robots.     

Test strategy    

It was planned that the legged platform was to undergo on-site testing at nuclear installations of optimised gaits over a range of geometrical obstacles, with a view to   defining a future mobile robotic platform with relative compactness, light weight and a power-efficient configuration for extensive maintenance applications in nuclear power plants.";;;;CSC;Technicatome SA;FR;"Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);Electricité de France;Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica SpA (ENEL);UNIVERSITAET KARLSRUHE (TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE);UNIVERSITE LIBRE DE BRUXELLES";"FR;IT;DE;BE";

The goal of the 'TELEMAN 15 - A.N.B.'  project was to provide a controller component building block to facilitate and enhance the reliability of navigation of teleoperated vehicles used in nuclear environments.  The project was explicitly restricted to vehicle control and environmental  model management. Other aspects necessary in a complete mobile system such as manipulator control or sensor dependent data  processing were to be incorporated from other TELEMAN projects later (see projects TM45 and TM50)
A controller component building block is being developed to facilitate and enhance the reliability of navigation of teleoperated vehicles used in nuclear environments. 

The 4 modules for task scheduling, motion generation, perception processing, and security supervision have been built and integrated into the test vehicle. These modules brought extra capabilities to navigate the vehicle in unpredictable, cluttered environments, as follows: 
navigation using high level commands under teleoperated control; 
location of the vehicle with respect to its perceived environment; 
real time planning of the most appropriate trajectory leading to the target; 
monitoring and control of vehicle motion; %: detection and avoidance of unexpected obstacles; 
protection from overhanging obstacles. 

The assistant navigation block (ANB) is able to work under 6 modes of operation, with smooth path transition when changing between the following modes: basic teleoperation, preprogrammed motion, move to point, wall following and corridor centred motion, passing through doors, and rescue and recovery mode. The human operator has overruling capability at all times when the system is navigating autonomously. The incorporation of multisensor fusion also means that the system is robust to perception errors and sensor inaccuracies.
Exploitation
As well as being individually exploited by the project partners in their own commercial and research applications, the project results are being further developed and integrated in two TELEMAN research machine projects, the TM45- IMPACT light tracked inspection vehicle and the TM50 - MESSINA robust intervention multi-bodied vehicle. In TM45 -, the TM15 - A.N.B. concept is being applied to a much smaller vehicle, requiring miniaturisation of the hardware, and two versions are being developed, one for basic tele-operation and the other with advanced navigation aids. In TM50, the concept is being extended to a multi-bodied vehicle with many more degrees of freedom. These examples show how, because of its generic desing, the concept can be applied to a wide range of vehicles with different locomotion systems. An interim version was demonstrated at the Hannover Fair in April 1994.
Work to be done  

'TELEMAN 15 - A.N.B.' was to be structured in four units with clear division of  responsibilities:    

-the task scheduler, (FHGIPA)    
-the movement generator, (ULB)    
-the perception processing unit (Framatome) and    
-the security supervisor (FHG-IPA)    

The project  was to proceed through the following steps:     

-analysis of the user requirements and available hardware constraints with direct respect to the project goal;     
-specification of  the functions and interrelations between the four units;     
-investigation and specification in detail of the approaches to be used, based on an incremental approach to handle the complexity;    
-implementation of the units separately including unit tests;     
-integration of  the software on a dedicated computer, testing and validation of  the software modules together;     
-integration of  the software and hardware on a test vehicle and   
-demonstration of  the system functioning in a realistic environment.     

Test strategy    

After testing of the individual units, the integrated system was to be fitted on the Framatome Frastar 2 mobile platform for testing in a realistic environment built at Equipos Nucleares.";;;;CSC;FRAUNHOFER-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;DE;"Equipos Nucleares SA;FRAMATOME ANP;Kerntechnische Hilfsdienst GmbH;Université Libre de Bruxelles";"ES;FR;DE;BE";

The objectives of the 'TELEMAN 17 - UKIS'  project were to design an intelligent observation and imaging system to allow an optimal presentation of world (and job) - related information to both the human operator and the control and planning systems of computer assisted teleoperators in the nuclear sector. Special attention was to be given to operation from a mobile platform in an enclosed space.
An intelligent observation and imaging system is being developed to allow an optimal presentation of world and job related information to both the human operator and the control and planning systems of computer assisted teleoperators in the nuclear sector. 

A dedicated test environment was designed and built and measurements using the 3 imaging sensor systems (ultrasonics, laser range finding, and stereo vision) were carried out to provide a first set of real data for development of the software for sensor fusion, world modelling, and object identification. A further set of measurements was made to refine the software before the final demonstration. A generic framework for sensor data fusion, world modelling, and object identification has been produced which is applicable to different forms of teleoperation in the nuclear industry. Furthermore a laboratory model of an ultrasonic imaging system with bistatic capabilities has been realised. Possibilities of sensor data fusion were demonstrated where data from multiple sensors and/or multiple viewpoints allow a significant increase in spatial resolution and a decrease in model uncertainty. Parameter representations have been chosen to describe the geometrical modelling primitives which provide a theoretically sound approach to sensor data fusion, and which at the same time are intuitively easy to understand for the human operator. Moreover the system can accommodate and process data from not only advanced state of the art sensors but also from everyday low resolution systems and still provide improved overall system performance.
Exploitation
The generic framewok for sensor data fusion produced by the TM17 - UKIS project is applicable in many areas where tele-operators and/or mobile robots operate with relatively high levels of autonomy in disordered or unpredictable environments. The project partners are therefore proposing to exploit their results not only in the nuclear industry but also in underwater and space applications. The building blocks from this project are being developed further for practical application within the TELEMAN TM45 - IMPACT light inspection vehicle research machine project, with a focus on producing rapid 3-D world models of the nuclear environment to aid planning of maintenance operations using tele-robotics.
Work to be done  

The system was to use knowledge of the capabilities of several sensor systems as well as geometrical knowledge of the environment to create an optimal, world related, image.  To create a flexible system, where both supervised and unsupervised data interpretation was to be possible, research activities were to be focussed on the fusion of information both at the sensor data level and at higher levels of information.  In relation to sensor fusion, the system was to address both world modelling and object recognition.  System design was to be based on the concept of logical sensors that were to hide the physical characteristics of the sensor systems involved and would therefore be a solid basis to include other applications and sensor systems in the future.

The 'TELEMAN 26 - SIMPLE' project was to concern the development of building blocks contributing to the ultimate development of an intelligent telerobotic gantry/manipulator system for use within a nuclear fuel processing or radioactive waste handling plant. This project was to relate specifically to the planning, programming, and simulation facilities for the telerobotic gantry/manipulator system to increase the system intelligence. It was to allow an easy and user oriented management of the telerobotic system. 
Building blocks are being developed which will contribute to the ultimate development of an intelligent telerobotic gantry and manipulator system for use within a nuclear fuel processing or radioactive waste handling plant.

The prototype of an integrated programming and simulation system has been developed and tested in a telerobotic demonstrator work cell. It contains the TOPSY programming system which is closely coupled with the KISMET graphical simulation system. A simulation interface to a robot hand controller has also been designed. Another main achievement was an experimental study of the automatic generation of programs to monitor and control remote handling missions with knowledge based methods. During this study, the knowledge base for a typical repair task (autonomous opening of a bolted flange connection) has been generated. Another important product developed was the prototype of a generalized man machine interface for kinematically redundant telemanipulator systems with supporting stereographic scene presentation. Central emphasis was laid on improving the stereographic visualization, for instance by removing the ghosting effect.
Exploitation
The integrated programming and simulation system consists of two major components which can be marketed together or seperately. The exploitation will mainly be performed by KfK, and is based on licencing agreements with industrial partners. The use in other internal or external KfK projects is also foreseen. The simulation interface of the hand-controller will be part of AEA's product spectrum on advanced robotic systems. The stereographic interface will be used by Nuclear Electric for in-reactor manipulator control in maintenance operations in their nulcear plants. The building blocks developed in the project are also being developed further for integration into the TM48 INGRID robust gantry-mounted manipulator research machine project.
Work to be done  

'TELEMAN 26 - SIMPLE' was to help to develop the off-line aspect of control by applying and modifying techniques known from robotics. Because the total system was to consist of many software and hardware components, standardised interfaces developed outside TELEMAN were also be used.  Tools for task planning, off-line programming and simulation were to be developed to work on shared data such as geometric and kinematic descriptions or motion target points, taking account of the special requirements of teleoperation. The tool development was to make use of concepts or modules from areas outside telerobotics such as artificial intelligence and off-line programming of industrial robots.  For maintenance tasks or after an accident, user-friendly programming facilities must be provided to allow an easy and quick generation of user programs for all cranes and robots belonging to the system. The basic concept was to integrate the different programming tools for cranes and manipulators, so that it would be possible to program a robot or a crane task (or both together) using the same tool.

The achievements of the research so far are:
construction of experimental set ups for the elemental analysis of rubber;
identification and assignment of all observed spectral features;
measurement of calibration curves for variety of interesting elements;
development of software for data evaluation and measurement control;
specification of material properties to be measured via element distributions.
This will be achieved by application of a new technique called laser-induced emission spectral analysis (LIESA) recently developed by Krupp for direct liquid steel elemental analysis in a steel plant. 
For industrial rubber mixing processes, for example, it is highly desirable to evaluate on-line the dispersion of the different ingredients in the polymer matrix (i.e. compound homogeneity).  Therefore the main objective of the project is the development of a laboratory system capable of in-process monitoring of the homogeneity of rubber slabs in the open mill and other locations in the early stage of a tyre production line. 
By scanning the focused beam of pulsed laser across the surface of rubber slabs in a rubbers mixing line, spatial element distributions will be measured and evaluated on-line.  The optical emission of the plasmas which are created at the focal spot (spot size up to 10mm2) of the laser beam during scanning, is detected for spectral microanalysis of the polymeric material.";;;;;Krupp Entwicklungszentrum GmbH;DE;"KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;Pirelli Coordinamento Pneumatici SpA";;

- to monitor the frequency of congenital anomalies in different regions of Europe in order to identify any variation that could be due to environmental teratogens or mutagens;
- to create a large data-set, accessible to European scientists, for clinical, etiological, genetic and health service researches;
- to establish an information centre for the promotion and the coordination of surveillance and research activities in the EEC Member States and other countries associated in the COST programmes (COST: European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research).
The epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies (the EUROCAT programme) was initially an experiment in European surveillance, to assess the feasibility, feasibility of pooling data across national boundaries, both in terms of standardization of definitions, diagnosis and terminology, and in terms of confidentiality. Surveillance was based on a network of regional registries covering geographically defined populations and recording standard epidemiological data on cases of structural malformation, chromosomal abnormality and metabolic defect. The participating registries are supported individually in the member states.

Trends and clusters in time are referred to local registries for investigation. The most important results are as follows:
confirmation of the downward trend of neural tube defects in the British Isles; 
a trend towards increasing maternal age which inevitably leads to an increasing total prevalence of Down syndrome;
an increase in urogenital anomalies in many regions which seems to be linked to an increasing use of ultrasound screenings, both prenatally and neonatally.

Geographic variation in the prevalence rate of neural tube defects and facial clefts was demonstrated. Down syndrome also varied in total prevalence, linked to the different maternal age structures of the populations. A number of other anomalies showing geographical variation in rates need further investigation to exclude possible methodological differences.

Prenatal diagnosis is having an increasing impact on the prevalence at birth of anomalies. Considerable variation in prenatal diagnosis impact exists between regions which can be linked to the different screening policies. The increase in prenatal diagnosis and abortion is combining in the British centres with the natural decline in total prevalence to produce a sharp decline in neural tube defect prevalence at birth. Guidelines, newsletters and reports are available. The latest report is EUROCAT Report 6-Surveillance of congenital anomalies in Europe 1980-1992.
One of the prerequisites for effective collaboration between the different centres was the standardization of the data collected, nomenclature and coding. Each case record transmitted to the coordinating centre includes standard information on the baby/fetus, mother, father, exposures and precise diagnoses. By validating centrally this data, by visiting the coordinating centre and local registries, and by organizing meetings for discussions, it has been possible to achieve a high degree of standardization. This however is a continuous process. The great value of comparison between different areas in the interpretation of data has been recognized and exploited.

EUROCAT performs routine monitoring including analysis of trends and identification of clusters and geographical variation. The aim of these analyses is to identify any variation that could be due to environmental teratogens or mutagens. In these analyses the ability to compare different regions following a standard methodology in data collection, and standard definitions and terminology has been extremely valuable. Nevertheless, the results also point to a continuing need for further harmonization between countries.

In 1993, 30 registries in 15 European countries are participating covering all together approximately 400,000 births per year or a roughly 10% sample of the births in the countries in which they are situated. Located initially at the Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels (1979-1991), the coordinating centre was transferred in 1992 to the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Belgian Ministry of Health, in Brussels. The central data base contained 58,000 cases up to 1990. Each case is documented with information on the baby and its precise diagnosis, on the mother, the father and key exposure history.";;;;CON;Institut d'Hygiene et d'Epidemiologie;BE;;;

- The creation of an European paediatric network where clinical trials on AIDS therapeutics can be conducted.
- To create uniform standards throughout the EEC for treatment of children infected with HIV.
- To establish uniform therapeutic procedures for new-borns of HIV infected mothers to reduce the rate of infection.
- To establish uniform technical procedures for early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic children.
- To establish uniform parameters for prognosis of HIV infection specially for neurological manifestations in order to adapt the therapeutical strategies.
The Paediatric European Network for Treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PENTA) was formed in 1990 with the aim of providing greater cohesion among paediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research and treatment centres throughout Europe. This has been accomplished through the development of several HIV protocols which will be initiated through 1994. The PENTA I trial Early versus deferred use of zidovudine (ZDV) in children with HIV infection born to HIV antibody positive mothers has started and continues to recruit patients. The Penta I protocol has enabled the network to standardise its statistical procedures, some therapeutic protocols and written forms. PENTA II is a randomized comparative trial of 2', 3' dideoxyinosine (ddI) versus ZDV plus ddI in HIV infected children previously treated with ZDV which will benefit directly from the ground work of PENTA I. Both tolerance and pharmacokinetic studies on ddI were done prior to the approval of the PENTA II project. The PENTA III study is a phase II trial comparing toxicity and tolerability of ZDV alone with ZDV and dideoxycystidine ddC in symptomatic antiretroviral naive infected children. It is due to start in early 1994 with a planned intake of 100 children.

PENTA I trial 'Early versus deferred use of Zidovudine in children with HIV infection (born to HIV antibody positive mothers)' has started and continues to recruit patients. Based on this protocol, which will continue for three years, the PENTA organisation was able to launch satellite interest groups which are directly relevant to the PENTA network: PENTA virologist group and PENTA-BRAIN.
The Penta I protocol has also enable the network to standardise its statistical procedures, some therapeutic protocols and written forms. Considering the great diversity of regulation that exist among the European countries, this represents a considerable accomplishment.

Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails.
The European study on antioxidants myocardial infarction and cancer of the breast (EURAMIC) multicentre case control study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that male myocardial infarction (MI) cases and female breast cancer (BC) cases have a lower antioxidant status than control subjects without these diseases. Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails. Data collection ended 31 October 1992 for the MI study, and 31 December 1992 for the BC study. For the MI study biomarker data has been collected for 712 cases and 733 controls. For the BC study the number of cases and controls is 318 and 466 respectively. The distribution of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in the different centres has been analysed for 90% of the data. Classical risk factors like smoking, hypertension and diabetes are significantly more prevalent in the cases. Laboratory analysis of antioxidants has not yet been completed. Mean alpha tocopherol and beta carotene levels, as well as a risk estimate for low pressure levels have been produced for 40% of the data. Remarkable differences exist between centres, southern countries showing a relatively low beta carotene level, but also the variation within centres is large. Small numbers for some centres in the analysis do not permit any conclusions to be drawn so far. Estimates of the relative risk of MI at low antioxidant levels show an increased risk for low adipose tissue beta carotene, but none for alpha tocopherol. These findings need further exploration, including possible interactions. Results for selenium status for about 1200 subjects have been obtained recently and data analysis is in progress.
Many studies have implicated free radical oxidative reactions in age-related disorders, such as cardiovascular and malignant disease. Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidative reactions by scavenging reactive oxygen-derived radicals and/or by interfering with the chain-reaction of peroxidation. Both vitamins (e.g., alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid) and enzyme-linked trace-elements (e.g., selenium, copper, zinc) are essential components of the antioxidant defense of the body.
It is hypothesized that the risk of developing age-related diseases is influenced by the balance between oxidant stress and antioxidant defense.
The fat-soluble antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene and the trace element selenium were investigated in the EURAMIC Study. These three substances may all be derived from usual dietary sources. Although the protective role of these substances has been studied separately in epidemiologic studies, their joint action over a wide range of dietary intake and antioxidant status is not well elaborated. As antioxidant requirements are related to fatty acid intake, especially of polyunsaturates, fatty acid composition is of additional interest.

Acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer have been selected as the diseases of interest. The sudden clinical occurrence of a first myocardial infarction and the diagnosis of breast cancer in an early stage, avoid secondary changes in life-style and exposure status.
Acute myocardial infarction is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in men and postmenopausal women. In addition to increased disease risk from smoking, elevated serum cholesterol and blood-pressure, antioxidants may beneficially affect cardiovascular disease risk by reducing oxygen-induced damage to lipids, lipoproteins and endothelial tissue. Breast cancer is the most important cancer among European women. In addition to reproductive and hormonal factors, which do not lend themselves to preventive measures, dietary factors including the natural antioxidants may be involved. Antioxidants may prevent oxygen-related DNA-damage in ductal epithelium of the mammary gland.

For acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer, the following hypotheses were tested in the EURAMIC Study:
1 The concentration of alpha-tocopherol and beat-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails is lowered in cases as compared to healthy population controls.
2 The shape of the antioxidant-disease relationship is non-linear, i.e. the increased risk may be most pronounced at low antioxidant concentration.
3 The antioxidants affect disease-risk synergistically, in particular for alpha-tocopherol and selenium. Furthermore, the alleged protective effect of beta-carotene may be particularly important at low alpha-tocopherol/selenium status or in smokers experiencing high oxidant stress.";;;;CON;TNO Food and Nutrition Institute;NL;;;

The European nosocomial infection survey (EURO.NIS) Concerted Action provided the opportunity of creating a large network of research groups and hospital wards in 14 European countries. This network will promote collaborative research and improve the prevention of nosocomial infections in European hospitals.

During the period of 1990 to 1992, the group carried out 2 large surveys, one in 1005 intensive care units (ICU) on their usual infection prevention practices, the other in 325 ICUs which followed 9127 patients using a standardized procedure to measure the frequency of nosocomial pneumonias. The determinants and consequences were analysed.

The 2 studies have made obvious the variability of the situation in European hospitals with respect to:
the functioning of each ICU and the resources available to them;
the organization of the prevention of nosocomial infections and techniques used;
the level of risk infection and the associated factors.

The results constitute a basis for current preventive activities, involving the drawing up of a reference book and of documents to be diffused in the specialized press, and then the preparation of technical guidelines as well as the corresponding educational programmes.
The specific objectives of the EURO.NIS Concerted Action were: 

A) To assess the level and nature of variability in health care practices related to NI occurrence, costs and prevention within ICU's in participating European Countries: 
- physical facilities and staffing 
- epidemiologic surveillance of infection 
- health care activities related to the prevention of NI 
- antibiotic policy 
- general procedure for infection control (isolation) 

This first objective of the Concerted Action focused on the dissemination of previously validated preventive measures and health care technologies (as those described in the CDC Guidelines). 

B) To undertake a detailed analysis of the situation of nosocomial pneumonia with regard to incidence, lethality, predictive factors, associated medical extra-costs and relative efficiency of the various prophylactic methods: 
- crude incidence of nosocomial pneumonia according to the patient's characteristics and the care delivered; 
- clinical and microbiological characteristics of nosocomial pneumonia; 
- risk factors associated with the occurrence of pneumonia and estimates of their specific impact; 
- level of lethality of nosocomial pneumonia; 
- role of nosocomial pneumonia as a risk factor for mortality in ICU patients; 
- role of nosocomial pneumonia in increasing the length of the stay; 
- cost of antibiotic treatment of nosocomial pneumonia.

It is, therefore, an important task for the European culture collections to draw attention to themselves and to the facilities they have to offer. An important stage in their future development is considered to be the coordination of the exchange of information between culture collections and the provision of an information service to users. 
The stock of catalogues has been extended so that copies from all European culture collections are now available. Catalogues from the most important collections outside Europe have been also obtained. Online access to the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDC) and to different national culture collections in Europe have been established. A list of names of bacteria has been compiled which are validly published as defined in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. A booklet on instructions for shipping non infectious and infectious biological substances was prepared and published. A study has been started on the deposit of microorganisms in culture collections.
The major tasks of the Information Centre for European Culture Collections (ICECC) are: 

To provide a permanent secretariat for all European culture collections and a central contact point for European scientists and any institution seeking advice and information on cultures and culture collection related matters. To act as a public relations office on behalf of culture collections in dealing with regulatory bodies and the media. To publish regularly an information newsletter. To cooperate closely with the CEC supported Microbial Information Network Europe (MINE). 

To collect information on the strains, cell lines and services offered by the European culture collections to users and to publicise the resources within the culture collections in terms of materials (preparation of printed and visual material for distribution) and scientific expertise. By participation at technical and scientific exhibitions, conferences, and congresses the ICECC demonstrates the importance of the services offered by European collections of biological material. 

To hold catalogues from the various participating culture collections and to consider development of a European catalogue. 

To keep close contacts with European research and biotechnology in order to inform or advise culture collections on new developments and requirements. 

To encourage scientists to deposit microbial strains and other biological specimens of biotechnological and/or of general scientific significance in European culture collections as an important future resource. 

To keep up to date information on national and international patent regulations and treaties for the benefit of depositors and depositories.

Experiments are carried out on selected materials in high pressure tanks (simulation tests), and laboratory analyses are performed. 
The parameters involved in the change of properties in a deep sea environment are identified and simulation tests in a high pressure tank have been carried out in order to test the behaviour of materials used for apparatus design in order to account for the effects of the true environments. The project partners combined unique test facilities and high scientific and technical skills in the field of materials behaviour in a deep sea environment. The first results show that hydrostatic pressure does not affect the corrosion resistance of high grade stainless steels and anodized aluminium alloys. The composite material is not significantly affected by pressure, either. However, high strength steels are more sensisitive to stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement under hydrostatic pressure.
The tested materials are mainly metallic alloys (stainless steel, High Strength Low Alloys steels, aluminium alloy, etc), and composite materials. The tested properties are corrosion, stress corrosion, fatigue corrosion behaviour of metallic alloys and composite materials aging (changes of physico-chemical and mechanical properties). 
A database on 'Materials behaviour in deep sea environment' will be set up to enable results to be communicated efficiently to the scientific and technical community.";;;;CSC;IFREMER - INSTITUT FRANÇAIS DE RECHERCHE POUR L'EXPLOITATION DE LA MER;FR;"NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF ITALY;Technical Research Centre of Finland";"IT;FI";

The probes will perform time and spatially resolved analysis of the composition of the gas. They will be small, providing high spatial resolution and minimum disturbance and designed for operation in hot, aggressive gases such as combustion exhaust and process offgas. The probes are conceived as having wide potential application, both in process development and routine process monitoring, for a range of industries. 

The key technologies in the project are: the infrared transmitting fluoride glass fibres; evanescent wave probe design; and infrared spectral analysis. 

The OPERA project will provide, for the first time, a single instrument capable of accurately monitoring the spatial and temporal variation of a wide variety of gaseous pollutants. This technology will be a major tool for the successful development of a wide range of clean technologies and for online monitoring of their performance. The OPERA system will remove the need for the complex and expensive suite of analytical instruments currently employed. 

The long term objective will be to reduce by more than 50% the cost of online flue gas monitoring in a small scale combustion plant. At the primary economic level, involvement of a small dynamic manufacturing organization on the OPERA team will maximise immediate economic benefits to the European Community, as Le Verre Fluore go on to commercialize the probes developed.

The project builds on the tomography expertise developed over a number of years at BAM and the expertise in detector design and operation in AEA Technology.
The primary goal of the project is the development through design, testing and demonstration of a nondestructive technique for the generation of tomographic images of highly radioactive objects such as glass monoliths of high level radioactive waste. The technique is based on the measurement of gamma ray transmissions with an electron linear accelerator as the photon source. The novel aspect of the technique is the use of Cerenkov counters for the detection of the transmitted gamma rays. Such detectors have a gamma ray energy response that exhibits a low energy threshold and a non-linear response up to gamma ray energies of several MeV. The use of detectors wthi such a response has important potential advantages in the context of tomography of highly radioactive objects. The intrinsically low sensitivity of the detectors to the low energy portion of the bremsstrahlung spectrum reduces the undesirable beam hardening effects which result from the rapid attenuation of this portion of the spectrum. It also provides discrimination against the low energy background from the objects, therby significantly improving the signal to background ratio in measurements.

The project involved work on all the amjor componets of the CT system, the detectors, collomators, data acquisition system and linac.

Following commissioning of the complete CT system trial tomograms were made of a simulated HLW glass monolith. These tomograms demonstrated the operation of the Cerenkov detector system and demonstrated that beam hardening artefacts, which were quite severe in the case of scintillation detector images, were absent in the images obtained with the Cerenkov detectors.
Work programme: 

The novel aspect of the technique is the used of Cerenkov counters for the detection of the transmitted gamma-rays. Such detectors have a gamma-ray energy response that exhibits a low energy threshold and a non-linear response up to gamma-ray energies of several MeV.
The detectors to the low energy portion of the Bremsstrahlung spectrum should reduce the beam hardening effects which result from the rapid attenuation of this portion of the spectrum by waste packages.
There are three main phases in the development of the HEAT technique:

- The design construction and testing of Cerenkov counters, collimators and a Bremsstrahlung converter.
- The optimisation of counter performance for tomographic measurements.
- The demonstration of HEAT on simulated waste.

These three phases are further subdivided into:

- Design and construction of Cerenkov detectors followed by testing.

5407;FI2T0028;IMPACT;;FP2-TELEMAN;;FP2;TELEMAN 45 - A light mobile tracked machine with advanced sensing, world modelling and communication;01/03/1993;29/02/1996;;"The overall objective is to develop a light mobile robot which can be quickly reconfigured with different sensors or communications systems for nuclear plant inspections in normal, incident, and accident conditions.  This versatile platform could be based locally at the plant and help to reduce radiation exposure of surveillance and maintenance personnel, and would enable rapid inspection in the event of an incident.
The IMPACT project has developed a lightweight inexpensive mobile robot that can be used for rapid inspection missions within the nuclear power plant. These interventions are to cover normal, incident and accident situations and aim at primary reconnaisance (or data collection missions).

The motivation behind IMPACT is to offer plant personnel an inexpensive mobile robot that could be based locally within the plant and not reserved exclusively to intervention groups.

The IMPACT robot was demonstrated in a realistic situation at a Russian nuclear plant at SMOLENSK. The following demonstration, composed of two independent but consecutive missions, was held in a radioactive zone of the plant:

Remote radiation mapping with hot spot localisation by the IMPACT robot equipped with a directional gamma radiation sensor.

Construction of a protective lead shield around one of the identified hot spots and verification that the amount of ambient radiation had been reduced. This mission was executed remotely by two mobile robots working in collaboration (ie a Russian interventon robot equipped with a manipulator arm carrying lead bricks and the IMPACT robot of the first mission.
Work to be done  

Two mobile three-segmented robots will be developed, one in a basic version, the other with more advanced navigation and control capabilities.  The detachable third segment can act as a relay station to transmit control and sensor signals between the base station and the mobile platform. The tasks can be divided into three areas:   

i) The mobile platform  
The basic platform will be fitted with multiple miniature cameras to aid teleoperation. The advanced platform will be equipped with an add-on navigation support system module to provide the operator with semi-autonomous functions such as automatic reverse in the event of loss of communications, camera drive, auto-centring in corridors and doorways, obstacle avoidance, and stair climbing. The multiple robots will cooperate to perform a mission and will also be able to rescue a stranded partner robot. 

ii) Environment inspection and CAD modelling  
Two different inspection methods will be developed. Firstly, data fusion of inputs from CCD cameras, temperature, radiation imaging, and scanning range-finder sensors will give a rapid, non-CAD model for preliminary inspection and problem identification. Then digital photogrammetry will give an accurate CAD/PDMS model for detailed intervention planning and execution. Both systems will operate on the same work station so the CAD geometrical model can be enriched with superimposed temperature and radiation fields.      

iii) Communications  
Communications and sensor signals will be transmitted without an umbilical cable using line of sight microwave and laser systems. The third platform segment will relay signals beyond the direct line of sight of the base station.   

Free space and obstacle mapping with a laser range finder will be performed in collaboration with the PIAP Institute, Warsaw, Poland. In addition, final year student research projects will be carried out at the Universities of Loughborough, Delft, and University College London.  

Test strategy  

The mobile robots will be tested at the start, mid-term, and end of the project in French, Spanish, and (former East) German nuclear power plants, and their ease of use and suitability will be assessed by actual plant personnel from the nuclear users in the project.";;;;CSC;Electricité de France;FR;"University College London;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO*;Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas;FRAUNHOFER-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;Empresa Nacional de Ingeniería y Tecnología SA;KENTREE LTD.;Kerntechnische Hilfsdienst GmbH;Université Libre de Bruxelles;COMMISSARIAT A L'ENERGIE ATOMIQUE";"UK;NL;ES;DE;IE;BE;FR";
2472;SC1*0387;GPM2M3;;FP2-SCIENCE;;FP2;GROWTH AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METALLIC MAGNETIC MULTILAYERS;01/11/1990;30/04/1992;;"The ability to grow epitaxial thin films and multilayers to an extremely high quality is a prerequisite for the observation and understanding of new magnetic phenomena. The control and characterization of growth mechanisms, the initial stage of growth (nucleation) and the final multilayer structure are critical steps in the achievement of this objective. Multilayers have been prepared which exhibit either extremely high quality or comprise entirely new (metastable) phases.
Iron/chromium is found to be a system of almost perfect lattice registry where coherent expitaxial growth occurs to considerable chromium and iron layer thicknesses. Multilayers and sandwiches of considerable perfection have been grown on lattice matched substrates (gallium arsenide and geranium).
A wide variety of cobalt containing multilayers and sandwich structures have been prepared using primarily molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques. Substrates have varied from mica and magnesium oxide to metallic single crystals such as platinum (100) and palladium (111). Buffer layers between substrate and multilayer have frequently been used to improve further the sample quality.
A wide variety of samples have been prepared by MBE techniques with one or more of the layers grown in the form of a wedge of varying thickness. Examples are chromium wedges prepared on galliumarsenide/iron substrates, chromium manganese and copper wedges prepared on iron (100) single crystalline whiskers, cobalt wedges prepared on copper (100)/cobalt substrates. Thickness dependencies of structural (and magnetic) properties can be directly obtained from a single sample by means of position sensitive measurements such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED).
A variety of techniques have been used to obtain structural information concerning the samples.

The internal energy of a ferromagnet depends on the direction of the magnetization. The term in the total energy describing this is called the magnetic anisotropy energy. In the case of an interface the surface atoms are in a very different environment than the bulk atoms. This can create a large anisotropy for these atoms which is called the surface or interface anistrophy. Because of the importance of magnetooptical (MO) recording, the largest effort of researchers has been to create ultrathin layers in which spin orbit type anisotropies overcome the strong in plane shape anisotropy. It is the interface term which in some systems can induce the magnetization to orientate perpendicular to the film plane, a situation which is essential for MO recording media.
A series of cobalt/X multilayers has been investigated, with X (equal to palladium, platinum, gold, silver, copper, iridium, molybdenum) being metals with widely differing lattice constants. No simple correlation was found between the strains induced in the cobalt layer by the lattice mismatch and the anisotropy in the multilayers. This suggests that the magnetostructure origin of anisotrophy (due to stress) is not the likely cause of interface anisotropy. Neel type anisotrophy originating from broken symmetry is the probable origin of perpendicular interface anisotropy.
Perpendicular anisotropy has been determined in cobalt/ruthenium, cobalt/osmium, cobalt/nickel, cobalt/platinum and iron/silver multilayers and in ultrathin epitaxial cobalt films on palladium (111) single crystals. In the latter system a very large weakly temperature dependent interface anisotrophy was measured in the absence of linear strain. The temperature dependence of the anisotropy, in the iron/silver system, was close to the third power of the magnetization.
Several established (volume selective magnetism (VSM), ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID)) and new (Kerr loops, modified VSM) measure ment techniques have been employed to determine the anisotropy in the samples. A modification of a Kerr effect apparatus has made it possible to obtain a local measurement of magnetic anisotropy. This technique has been applied to a wedge formed cobalt/palladium (111) sample, whereby both interface and volume contributions to the anisotropy have been obtained from a single sample.

The mechanism of the coupling of ferromagnetic layers through nonmagnetic interlayers has been investigated. Of special interest are the system iron/silver for which no antiferromagnetic (AF) type coupling has been reported, the system iron/chromium for which AF coupling is well established and the systems iron/copper and cobalt/copper which show weak AF type coupling. For cobalt/copper, in addition, a strong magnetoresistance (MR) effect was found. In the case of iron/chromium the relation between antiferromagnetic coupling and the grant magnestoresistive effect has been clarified.
More details of the interlayer coupling for the iron/chromium/iron system have been revealed by Brillouin light scattering experiments. It appears that the coupling not only oscillates in magnitude or in function of the chromium interlayer thickness (with a period of 20 Angstrom) but also changes sign (from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic). The Neel temperature of the chromium was determined, by conversion electron Mossbauer spectrometry (CEMS), to be below room temperature, suggesting that the coupling may be through a paramagnetic chromium film.
Several samples with layers deposited in the form of wedges have revealed extremely fine details in the oscillatory AF coupling. Additional short (approximately 2 monolayers) oscillatory periods have been discovered in the iron/chromium, iron/manganese, iron/gold, iron/copper and cobalt/copper systems. The structure of the copper interlayers of the latter 2 samples (iron/bcc copper and cobalt/fcc copper) is seen to totally change the oscillatory coupling. Longer oscillatory coupling periods have been determined in iron/aluminium and cobalt/ruthenium samples.
Giant oscillating MR has been measured in cobalt/copper (111) and iron/copper (111) multilayers. In both systems the oscillating period is seen to be about 12.5 Angstrom but the phase is opposite. A maximum MR in cobalt/copper corresponds to a minimum in iron/copper. An MR ration of 8 0% has been measured in cobalt/copper multilayers with 10 Angstrom copper layers. Changing the growth direction of the cobalt/copper multilayers to (100) modifies the oscillatory period of the grant MR, in agreement with that observed in the coupling studies.
The long oscillating period in both the AF coupling and MR can be theoretically modelled by a rather simple modification of the Rudermann-Kittel Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) theory. The short and multiple oscillatory periods discovered in iron/copper and cobalt/copper can also be described within the bounds of a straightforward physical theory.

The focus of work has been the preparation and characterization of metallic multilayers with unusual and intriguing magnetic properties, and the detailed understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms.

The ability to grow epitaxial thin films and multilayers of an extremely high quality was a prerequisite for this work. Considerable ingenuity was also shown in the structural characterization of the samples with many techniques being used.

The key issues studied in the field of magnetic anisotropy in magnetic multilayers are the differing contributions of volume and interface terms to the total anisotropy, and the origin of the interface term. It is the interface term which, in some systems, can induce the magnetization to orientate perpendicular to the film plane, which is essential for magnetooptical recording media.

Magnetic interlayer coupling and magnetoresistance has also been studied. Of special interest are the iron silver systems, for which no antiferromagnetic (AF) type coupling has been reported, the iron chromium system, for which AF coupling is well established, and the iron copper and cobalt copper systems, which show weak AF type coupling. For cobalt copper, in addition a strong magnetoresistance effect was reported. The relation between, in the iron chromium case, AF coupling and the giant magnetoresistance effect had to be clarified quantitatively.
The project is concerned with the growth and the study of physical properties of metallic magnetic superlattices. Six systems of primary interest have been selected: Co -Pd, Pt, Au, Cr and Fe - Cr, Ag. A fundamental understanding of the properties is of great significance for emerging applications of multilayers in areas like magnetic field sensors and recording media. The consortium combines existing experience in advanced UHV depostion with in-situ and ex-situ assessment techniques. Besides growth and the assessment of physical properties, the objectives are to gain insight into both the micro-magnetic structure and the magnetic order and finally to explore the possibility of new systems and effects in corresponding material systems.";;;;CSC;Nederlandse Philips Bedrijven BV;NL;"FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH;Eindhoven University of Technology;UNIVERSITE LOUIS PASTEUR, STRASBOURG 1;UNIVERSITE DE PARIS-SUD XI;Thomson-CSF";"DE;NL;FR";

The objectives of this project is to evaluate some economically feasible industrial oil crops for the chemical industries. The research conducted in VOICI involves the total production column, including plant breeding, primary production, agrotechnology (oil mills), and evaluation and application of a range of plant oils. The perspectives of further agricultural development of Crambe abyssinica and Dimorphotheca pluvialis are very promising. There are clear indications that agronomy and breeding can contribute towards an increase of the seed yields of these 2 crops. The development of Limnanthes alba is difficult and complicated.
Analytical methods for the assessment of oil characteristics have been further developed, as have extraction methods. The production of Crambe oil was conducted without problems, but oil recoveries of Dimorphotheca pluvialis were not satisfactory. The assessment of the oils made by the industrial partners revealed that the 3 VOICI oils do have potential. The partners indicate that the results so far obtained justify continuation of their R&D work. It is too early to predict future commercialization of these oil crops but some are looking promising.
The agronomy and breeding of Limnanthes alba, Crambe abyssinica and Dimorphotheca pluvialis will be studied and the crops established by farmers with a view to providing raw material for oil production on a large, precommercial scale. This will allow optimization of the processing of these crops and provide samples of sufficient size for the participants from the chemical industry. The  oils will be evaluated for the production of oleochemicals (amides, dimers), lubricants, resins and lacquers and to provide information on how to improve the agronomy and oil production technology for these crops. The utility of meadow foam oil for the cosmetics industry will also be tested. 

The expected outcome from this project is manifold and spreads over the entire production chain. The primary production end should have more knowledge of the management of these new or unconventional crops and a good estimation of the potential yield and quality will be possible. The processing of these crops into oils of industrial quality will be carried out and experience will be gained on the process technology necessary. A wide range of potential chemical end uses will be evaluated for the oils and very useful information be provided regarding their use as lubricants, additives, hydraulic fluids, lubricating greases, thickener components, resins and lacquers.

Pre-hospital thrombolysis has been advocated as a way of treating more patients earlier EMIP (European Myocardial Infarction Project) is a large-scale randomised study which was set up and sponsored by the European Economic Community through its Medical Research Program to assess the risks and benefits of such an approach
To determine the theoretical risk/benefit ratio of prehospital thrombolytic treatment, the European Myocardial Infarction Project (EMIP) was established. In a double blind, randomised trial, prehospital thrombolysis was compared with in hospital treatment. Anistreplase was the chosen thrombolytic agent because, being administered as a bolus, it is suitable for a prehospital setting. The study involved 5469 patients who received either 30 units of anistreplase at home followed by placebo after hospital admission, or placebo at home followed by 30 units of anistreplase after hospital admission. In 92.4% of cases, the diagnosis of suspected myocardial infarction was confirmed by the hospital cardiologist. Minor adverse reactions were more frequent in the early treatment group but the incidence of severe adverse reactions such as cerebral bleeding, ischaemicstrokes and severe bleeding was similar in both groups. As severe bleeding was among the main concerns expressed about prehospital thrombolysis, it is important to note that there was no occurrence of severe bleeding before admission and only one after admission, prior to the second injection. The frequency of reinfarction, ventricular fibrillation, acute pulmonary oedema, shock and cardiac arrest was the same in both groups. A total of 569 deaths was observed at 30 days, mortality being 13% lower in the early treatment group. The risk ratio decreased with increasing time gained by early treatment (the interval between injections). Death from cardiac causes was 16% lower in the early treatment arm, the result being at the limit of statistical significance (p=0.049). EMIP has thus proved prehospital thrombolysis to be feasible and safe, with no more incorrect diagnosis of myocardial infarction than in hospital, provided that the teams are well equipped and staffed.
A pilot study, sponsored by the EEC showed that a gain of one to two hours could be expected from a pre-hospital strategy with pre-hospital administration of a thrombolytic agent, compared with the current hospital strategy.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of administering a thrombolytic agent to patients with suspected myocardial infarction as early as possible after the onset of symptoms in a pre-hospital setting. Anistreplase was chosen because it can be administered as a slow bolus. Patients were randomised to receive anistreplase either as a pre-hospital treatment or after hospital admission, but this comparison goes beyond that of a simple comparison of two treatments, it is a comparison of two treatment strategies involving different settings and staff with different backgrounds. The evaluation of all aspects of safety of the two strategies is, therefore, of utmost importance.";;;;CON;Unité de Pharmacologie Clinique;FR;;;

A database has been compiled of the clinical features of diseases presenting as jaundice in over 128 centres in 26 European countries. The database covers adequately at least 45 disease conditions. The agreement among 4 observers examining a case according to the protocol was measured on 111 doctors in 8 countries. It was consistently 84-89% regardless of language. Norms for the 12 common blood tests used in diagnosing jaundice were based on the results of 75000 tests. Normal ranges were obtained on 220 controls (11 centres) and laboratory variation on 6 standard samples tested in 22 centres. A problem in standards was discovered. Audit feedback on their cases in comparison to the database as a whole was provided to the centres, listing missing data, mix of diseases, symptom frequencies and the diagnostic accuracy of the program on their cases (a pan European audit), and summaries of their case. The use of the protocol and of feedback to the observers improved the diagnostic quality of the data by 12%, the diagnostic accuracy of the doctors by up to 50% and the omission rate of the data 3-fold. Diagnostic programs were prepared by Bayesian, pattern recognition, likelihood ratio, neural net and knowledge based techniques. The crude Bayesian version based on quality case achieved 72% accuracy. Circulated for field test it attained 50% while a trial algorithm reached 75% (106 cases reported by 12 centres to data) Neural net and hybrid knowledge approaches outperformed Bayes. The threshold for assessment of the value added by diagnostic technology was reproducibly set by computer diagnosis. The added value of each blood test was demonstrated. The residual scope for new technologies was also established, but may be affected by refinement of computer diagnosis and development of more user friendly interface.

During the course of the project reciprocal participation has occurred with other European projects in related fields.
Methodology 

The project was in effect a clinical trial of clinical data from a clinical and bioengineering point of view, reflecting practice on the ground. It is not an epidemiological or statistical exercise. 

The over-riding considerations were the European dimension, the uniformity of case gathering, adequate numbers of cases and an effective diagnostic method. 

The participating hospitals were self-chosen, unfunded and dependent on local conditions. They included university, large municipal, district and small hospitals, and medical, surgical, hepatology, and mainly, gastro-enterology units. All instruments (data-set, disease-set, proforma, brochure, video; data entry, edit and diagnostic programs; feedback and database were constructed in wide consultation, field-tested in all centres, amended, retested in the field and adopted.";;;;CON;University College Hospital;IE;;;
3923;MR4*0060;EUROCAT;;FP2-MHR 4C;2.2;FP2;European registration of congenital anomalies;01/07/1988;15/05/1990;;"The objectives of the programme are:
- to monitor the frequency of congenital anomalies in different regions of Europe in order to identify any variation that could be due to environmental teratogens or mutagens;
- to create a large data-set, accessible to European scientists, for clinical, etiological, genetic and health service researches;
- to establish an information centre for the promotion and the coordination of surveillance and research activities in the EEC Member States and other countries associated in the COST programmes (COST: European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research).
The epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies (the EUROCAT programme) was initially an experiment in European surveillance, to assess the feasibility, feasibility of pooling data across national boundaries, both in terms of standardization of definitions, diagnosis and terminology, and in terms of confidentiality. Surveillance was based on a network of regional registries covering geographically defined populations and recording standard epidemiological data on cases of structural malformation, chromosomal abnormality and metabolic defect. The participating registries are supported individually in the member states.

Trends and clusters in time are referred to local registries for investigation. The most important results are as follows:
confirmation of the downward trend of neural tube defects in the British Isles; 
a trend towards increasing maternal age which inevitably leads to an increasing total prevalence of Down syndrome;
an increase in urogenital anomalies in many regions which seems to be linked to an increasing use of ultrasound screenings, both prenatally and neonatally.

Geographic variation in the prevalence rate of neural tube defects and facial clefts was demonstrated. Down syndrome also varied in total prevalence, linked to the different maternal age structures of the populations. A number of other anomalies showing geographical variation in rates need further investigation to exclude possible methodological differences.

Prenatal diagnosis is having an increasing impact on the prevalence at birth of anomalies. Considerable variation in prenatal diagnosis impact exists between regions which can be linked to the different screening policies. The increase in prenatal diagnosis and abortion is combining in the British centres with the natural decline in total prevalence to produce a sharp decline in neural tube defect prevalence at birth. Guidelines, newsletters and reports are available. The latest report is EUROCAT Report 6-Surveillance of congenital anomalies in Europe 1980-1992.
One of the prerequisites for effective collaboration between the different centres was the standardization of the data collected, nomenclature and coding. Each case record transmitted to the coordinating centre includes standard information on the baby/fetus, mother, father, exposures and precise diagnoses. By validating centrally this data, by visiting the coordinating centre and local registries, and by organizing meetings for discussions, it has been possible to achieve a high degree of standardization. This however is a continuous process. The great value of comparison between different areas in the interpretation of data has been recognized and exploited.

EUROCAT performs routine monitoring including analysis of trends and identification of clusters and geographical variation. The aim of these analyses is to identify any variation that could be due to environmental teratogens or mutagens. In these analyses the ability to compare different regions following a standard methodology in data collection, and standard definitions and terminology has been extremely valuable. Nevertheless, the results also point to a continuing need for further harmonization between countries.

In 1993, 30 registries in 15 European countries are participating covering all together approximately 400,000 births per year or a roughly 10% sample of the births in the countries in which they are situated. Located initially at the Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels (1979-1991), the coordinating centre was transferred in 1992 to the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Belgian Ministry of Health, in Brussels.

The Data Integrating Nodes (DIN) (Fungi/Yeasts: CBS, BAARN; Bacteria: LMG, Ghent) were provided with the most recent data and, afer processing and integration, report files were prepared. Guidelines were established for correction and harmonization of data. The format of the central data base and coordination of supply of data were discussed. There was participation in the establishment of an European data base on plasmids, virusses and transposable elements and a common format was established for fungi yeasts and bacteria.

The project proposed here is a natural follow-up of MINE. In the MINE project under BAP, programmes have been developed 
for common formats for data storage, and a network of 
databases has come into existence that allows exchange of 
data. Data have been entered partially. Each participant 
reported its progress individually. Monitoring the quality of the input must be continued. Under BRIDGE the aim is to 
complement data of each member collection, harmonizing the 
full data sets by integration programs at the dataintegrating nodes and making all those data available on-line in a central database node. It is further aimed at extending the system by incorporating more collections of different 
kinds of micro-organisms and more EC- and non-EC countries.

The ultimate goal was to establish a real European network of sentinel practices. 
Activities in the field of sentinel practices have been coordinated with general practitioners (GP) in order to establish a real European network of sentinel practices. An international surveillance on measles, mumps, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody tests and influenza like illness was started and a 1 month descriptive study on laboratory tests in general practice was carried out.

The sentinel networks are now established, but their heterogeneity is considerable. It was decided to continue the international data collection on measles, as an indicator to control impact of vaccination policy, using diagnostic guidelines along the lines of the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-defined).

Participants of the networks should seek serological confirmation, in view of the unreliability of the clinical diagnosis. The vaccination status of the cases should be documented by a medical record or a vaccination card. Incidence of measles can be expressed as the number of new cases per GP per week or per year, but it was convened that only full time equivalent GPs should be accepted. When using GPs as denominators, to study trends of incidence of a health problem over time, it should be convened that participating GPs provide during short separate periods of time their number of encounters by age groups and gender. In the international data collection on HIV tests in general practice, the numerator was all patients for whom an HIV test was prescribed in general practice but the categories of reason(s) for testing were not the same in all networks. The standard tables on this matter were thus a compromise enabling global comparisons of the reason(s) for testing between the networks. As for the denominator, the same problems were encountered as for the international data collection on measles and mumps.

For the surveillance of influenza like illness diagnostic guidelines along the lines of the International Classification o f Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-defined) should be used.
The following objectives were defined to be met in the course of the project. 

The first and main objective was to encourage and assist in the development of sentinel networks in as many member countries as possible, with as least 30 participants routinely recording information about a small number of carefully chosen conditions, and respecting some discipline and basic rules in relation to, eg quality of data gathering, regular transmission of data to a central facility, and regular feedback of information to the participants. The second objective was to start international recording of conditions in which there was a specific international interest, with the collaboration of already existing networks. 

Elements hampering the comparison of data collected internationally had to be defined and possible solutions for a further harmonization of the data recording and thus towards a real European network of sentinel practices had to be discussed.";;;;CON;Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology;BE;;;

The project will be concerned in particular with : 
the development of an integrated methodology, procedural steps and corresponding personal computer subroutines for analyzing and assessing risk from single and/or clustered industrial installations handling hazardous materials; 
the development of a decision making framework and corresponding software tool for regional planning of industrial and urban complexes, including land use planning and siting policies for single and clustered industrial installations; 
and the development of a decision making framework and corresponding software tool for developing emergency response plans for use by local and regional authorities. 

Input to this project will consist of existing models for predicting the accident scenaria and their corresponding frequency of occurence, dispersion of hazardous substances in the environment, dose response models, and consequence assessment.  Models based both on theory and experiments will be considered.  Furthermore, input will consist of existing theory and procedures for decision making and practices for emergency response. 

The work will integrate these models and procedures, expand theory and methodology when necessary and produce the required techniques and/or software.  Evaluation of the results will take place using the Thessaloniki industrial areas as a test object.  Further details of the work process are given in the description of the different tasks. 

10 tasks have been identified encompassing : integration of simplified models; development of relevant models (seismic, physical releases, dispersion paths (complex, soil, aquatic), health assessment, environmental consequences, emergency and close response); integration of first 5 tasks into a user friendly package; development of decision making frameworks for assessing optimum emergency response plans, and for establishing optimum land use and siting policies; and application of the above to the Thessaloniki industrial area of Greece.";;;;CSC;NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 'DEMOKRITOS';EL;"Dienst Centraal Milieubeheer Rijnmond;IBM Bergen Scientific Centre;KEMAKTA KONSULT AB;Université de Liège";"NL;NO;SE;BE";

b)    data sets,

(ii) which are relevant for the documentation of changes in these processes due to climate variability andor the impact of man's activity.

The general setup foresees three sites arranged nearly triangularly at a distance of about 100 km and at each site there will be a couple of stations arranged around one central station to achieve the nested higher resolution of one to two kilometers. 
During a period of about 10 days it is expected that up to four aircraft will measure atmospheric parameters and remote sensing data above the whole plain. The aircraft equipped with eddy-correlation instruments for flux measurements have to play the integrating role for the experimental area. Supported by frequent radiosonde ascents at different locations near the experimental area it should be possible to derive from these measurements also the advective fluxes, which may play an important role under dry conditions. These may result from large scale circulation including the intrusion of Mediterranean air masses from the south-east and Atlantic air masses from the west into a continental heat low. 
Satellite data will be used to measure the albedo of the surface as well as the diurnal temperature wave and its changes with the retreat of the vegetation during the drying season. 
The role of the vegetation in the exchange of water between soils and the atmosphere will be assessed by random sampling surveys on leaf-areaindex, PAR, spectral reflectance, stomata resistance and biomass production. It is further planned to analyse soil samples with respect to their physical properties and to determine the soil moisture content by different methods. 
To validate the data obtained from satellites and the methods used in the processing of these data, mobile measurements are foreseen. 
The experimental results which will finally be obtained have to be imbedded in climatological and meteorological background data for the Iberian peninsula in order to find out to what degree the experimental phase covers average or extraordinary climatological conditions.

Furthermore, the assessment was intended to cover a gap in the specific supranational study was yet available, and notable variations among countries are observed in blood self-sufficiency, organisation and financing of transfusion services, prevalence of viral infectious disease transmission, and in the costs. 
In order to improve the quality of transfusion in elective surgery, the Concerted Action on the safe and good use of blood in surgery (SANGUIS) was established. It assessed how much, when, and why blood, blood components, blood derivatives, and artificial colloids were used in 6 common surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, colectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysectomy, total hip replacement, aortocoronary bypass, and transurethral prostatectomy. The project totalled 8118 patients in 43 university hospitals and 10 countries. Data were collected in both surgical units and transfusion services. The study has revealed large variations in the use of individual blood components, autologous blood, blood derivatives, and artificial colloids, even within the same country. In red cell transfusion, for instance, the hospital was the major predictive factor, alongside patient haematological data. Many hospitals provided only scant data on the reasons for transfusion, and discrepancies were noted in the transfusion information recorded by surgical units and transfusion services. The results of data analysis will be redistributed to participating clinicians, providing a basis for discussion and improvement.
Blood is a natural resource and hence limited, exaustable, and costly. In clinical practice blood transfusion is a not replaceable support; however blood transfusion carries besides benefits also risks, including those of viral disease transmission. Although in the last decade a number of strategies have been promoted to enhance the safety of blood transfusion, a comparable improvement in the clinical use of blood and components, accompanied by an evaluation of the patient outcome in relation to varying transfusion regimes is less documented. In fact, inappropriateness in the clinical use of blood and interhospital variability for the same patient category are documented, although results of consensus development conferences and guidelines for clinical audit have been published. In blood transfusion, as for other clinical fields, the main issues still open to debate include the need for a more complete scientific knowledge on the transfusion indications, the identification and implementation of means whereb  effectively translating the scientific knowledge into practice, the assessment and improvement of the clinical transfusion practice and the evaluation of the patient outcome in relation to the transfusion regimen given.";;;;CON;Centro Trasfusionale e di Immunologia dei Trapianti;IT;;;

This project is a preliminary test phase of the HAPEX-II-SAHEL programme scheduled for 1992 in Niger, which is a part of large scale land-surface field experiments to obtain quantitative understanding of the water and energy cycles over extended land areas. 
The general strategy is to gather intensive measurements in 3 selected areas, hereafter called 'supersites' and to extend the results to an area significant for climate studies (i.e. 100 km x 100 km area). 
Soil moisture measurements, measurements of the ecophysiological functioning of the vegetation in conjunction with biometric ones, as well as measurements of the spectral characteristics of the vegetation and soil will be carried out in many locations in each 'supersite'. The resulting data will be used to calibrate local transfer models and to validate remote sensing inverse models which will be used for upscaling of soil hydraulic parameters and transport resistance. 
Spatial extension of surface fluxes at the scale of the 'supersites' will be performed using mostly aircraft remote sensing. In addition, onedimensional transfer models will be calibrated at this scale. 
Satellite data, vegetation and soil maps and meteorological data gathered by ground station networks and radiosounding to describe the atmospheric forcing will finally be used to extend the surface fluxes to a climatologicaly significant area. The resulting fluxes will be checked using direct measurements from aircraft.

The objective of the DEBORA-project is the 'Development of Borehole Seals for High-Level Radioactive Waste'.
The DEBORA-project consists of two phases. During the first phase (1991-1994) a test plan for a subsequent in situ verification test will be developed in form of a desk study. This study will include an evaluation of literature, a performance of model calculations, and discussions of experts to identify the requirements for and the tasks of HAW-borehole seals under normal repository conditions.

The overall objective of a nuclear repository is to protect man and his environment against ionizing radiation from radioactive waste emplaced in this underground repository.

According to section 45 of the German Radiation Protection Ordinance, the individual dose to man, caused by radionuclides passing out of the repository, is to be limited to 0.3 millisieverts/year. In order to achieve this objective within the multiple barrier system of the respository, suitable sealing systems like shaft seals, drift seals, and borehole seals are to be developed.

The objective of the DEBORA-project is the development of borehole seals for high level radioactive waste. Because the technical boundary conditions of a repository represent the most imortant basis for all further works, a compilation of these conditions has been made initially, together with a definition of the tasks of high level radioactive waste (HAW) borehole seals. An important item is the thermomechanical load on the HAW borehole seal. In the discussion on this loading, the filling strategy of the borehole seemed to be an important aspect. It was decided to try to determine by numerical analysis which aspects of the filling strategy would have a large influence on the thermomechanical loading and which would have a small influence. Having identified the most sensitive aspects one can concentrate on these items for further resarch in this project.

The first thermal and structural analyses have been made to determine the influence of the stack length on the area where the borehole seal is situated. Also, structural analyses have been made to determine the area around a gallery influenced by the excavation activities.

2) To describe and to compare care processes for cancer patients in Europe through the collection of extra information besides data that are usually recorded by cancer registries. 
EUROCARE is a Concerted Action on survival and care of cancer patients in Europe, based on data of population cancer registries. The project describes and compares survival of cancer patients in Europe and care processes for cancer patients in Europe through the collection of extra information besides data that are usually recorded by cancer registries.

The study is carried out on cases of invasive cancer diagnosed in the period 1978 to 1985 and follow up of at least 5 years. All major cancer sites are included, 28 registries participate in the study from 12 countries, and a database of over a million patients has been constituted. Data are collected according to a standardized protocol, the variables studied are those usually recorded by cancer registries. A systematic check has been performed on the whole database and errors and incongruences have been corrected through direct contact with local registries. An 'Atlas of cancer survival in Europe' will be published as an International Agency for Research on Cancer scientific monograph. This book will contain basic survival analysis for each cancer site, with comparisons among countries. Besides this, a detailed study on colon cancer, carried out on 74 325 patients evidenced a high variability in survival among European countries, which cannot be explained by sociodemographic factors such as age distribution, sex, criteria of inclusion of cases, general mortality levels. In 1981, 5-years survival of patients aged 60 to 69 ranged from a maximum of 52% to a minimum of 20%.

A further study was carried out on breast and lung cancer cases diagnosed in 1987, using the existing information on therapy. Data of 17 registries were processed; the proportion of patients not treated varied from 2% to over 30%. Besides, this survey, a detailed collection of information on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures has been carried out for breast and colorectal cancers diagnosed in 1990; 'ad hoc' forms have been adopted for this part of the study.
In most European countries population based cancer registries are active, providing incidence and mortality; some cancer registries currently analyze survival and are developing studies on care of cancer patients. However, survival data recorded by cancer registries are often not sufficiently standardized to allow reliable comparisons, as some practices of registration, criteria of inclusion of cases and age distribution may vary from country to country. 

The EUROCARE project was proposed in order to gather standardize and analyse survival and care data collected at population level. It is well known that biological and clinical variables recorded by cancer registries are by far less detailed than the corresponding data derived from clinical studies. On the other hand, population-based data are in principle not affected by selection bias, therefore are representative of the entire population; also, these studies are indirect indicators of the effectiveness of health measures and of their impact on the general population. Population-based survival data are therefore best suited for temporal and/or geographical comparisons. Studies describing the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can help in interpretation of the observed intercountry and over time survival differences.";;;;CON;Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori;IT;;;

Neutron dose rates are measured resulting from direct radiation and from neutrons scattered by the surrounding host rock (rock salt). Computer codes and model calculations are to be verified by these experiments. Thus, an experimentally validated tool will be available for future detailed repository planning with emphasis on minimizing the radiation exposure of the operating personnel.
The project was a demostration test which was reformed by DBE and ANDRA/CEA in the Asse mine. The objective of this experiment was to investigate radiological aspects of handling spent fuel/high level waste in the drifts of an underground repository in a salt dome. As neutrons play an important role in the direct disposal option, main emphasis was laid on their contribution to total dose rate. Due to the narrow drift dimensions, backscattering of the neutrons from the drift walls had to be expected, thus increasing the dose rate for the operating personnel.

The experimental results showed that the intensity od neutron backscattering from the drift walls depends upon the drift cross section and the position of the cask within the drift. The equivalent dose rate in the near-field of the cask during underground handling was two to three times higher that above ground. Predictions performed with the Monte Carlo programmes MORSE, MCNP and TRIPOLI were in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Thus, validated computer codes are available for future detailed repository planning with emphasis on minimising radiation exposure of the operating personnel.

Zidovudine was introduced in the clinical management of patients with advanced HIV infection in 1987.
Patients who started zidovudine after the time of the AIDS diagnosis had a decreased risk of dying within the first 1-2 years after time of initiation of therapy compared to untreated patients. However, the effect seems to be limited to 2 years after starting therapy.
There appears to be only minor differences between men and women in the clinical course of AIDS.
For patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as their initial diagnosis, no improvement in survival time was observed.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the leading complication to the HIV infection.
Improvement in survival from the pneumonia may be due to increased awareness of early symptoms of PCP and improved treatment, whereas the introduction of zidovudine and the routine use of secondary PCP prophylaxis may be responsible for the increased survival 1 and 2 years after the diagnosis observed in recent years.";;;;CON;University of Copenhagen;DK;;;

The survey included a questionnaire, personal interviews, anthropometric measurements and biochemical assays. Investigators recorded alarmingly high body mass index (BMI) values in some towns (Poland, Spain, central Italy, the Greek mainland) and a significant prevalence of low values in others (Norway, Hungary, Crete). Serum albumin, haemoglobin, and haematocrit levels were generally satisfactory at all centres. A geographical pattern emerged for blood lipid levels (lower in Mediterranean countries) but not for the vitamin B6 levels was widespread and biochemical deficiencies in vitamin B 12 or alpha-tocopherol were found at a few centres. Good functioning and self perceived global health tended to be better in men than in women, but the gender difference was smaller for theprevalence of chronic disease and use of medicines.

Prompted by the greying of the European Society, and the necessity to maintain good health and performance at older age with nutrition as an important contributing factor, the Project Management Group of EURONUT in 1986 decided to embark on a study of nutritional problems and needs that older people experience. In 1987 and 1988 several meetings were held to develop a common protocol and to discuss the design of the study, selection of participants, data collection and the standardization of procedures. All details have been described in one of the EURONUT reports. In 1988 the European-wide multicenter study, named EURONUT-SENECA, was started to explore cross-cultural differences in nutritional issues, life-style factors, health and performance of European elderly people. At present, EURONUT-SENECA provides baseline data necessary for the appraisal of the nutrition and health situation of elderly people in Europe. It also provides a solid base for longitudinal study in which specific hypotheses of healthy aging can be tested.

This EURONUT EC Concerted Action has given specific attention to the following four concerted action sub-programmes:

A) Nutrition and the Elderly in Europe: EURONUT-SENECA;
B) Surveillance of Dietary Habits with regard to Cardiovascular Diseases: MONICA-WHO-EURONUT;
C) Nutrition, Body Fat Distribution and Health Risks: The European Fat Distribution Study - EURONUT;
D) The Growth and Development of Children: EURONUT-Growth Study.";;;;CON;Wageningen Agricultural University;NL;;;

2. Multi-centre trials of existing devices and of new technologies, exchange of evaluation results among the Centres involved in order to improve their value and reliability. 
3. Coordination of methodologies and protocols for technical, functional and clinical evaluation of mobility aids. 
4. Dissemination of research and testing results to industries, research centres and rehabilitation Centres throughout Europe. 
The major achievements of a European project to evaluate technical aids for paralysed people are as follows:
techniques and algorithms have been developed for investigation into human gait modelization and functional evaluation of walking recovery in paralysed patients;
creation of a European network for multicentre clincial trials of the assistive devices for restoration of walking in patients with high level spinal lesions, using the same methods and protocols for patient selection, training, device adaptation and patient assessment;
research into electrodes (surface and implantable) and stimulation patterns for functional electrical stimulation (FES), supported also by experiments on animals;
development of models for control strategies in walking by FES and their preliminary validation on patients;
investigation into the ergonomics of wheelchairs and into its influence on design parameters, construction aspects, prescription criteria and fitting processes;
study of technical testing techniques and methodologies and investigation into their comparability in view of promoting implementation of international standards;
development and validation of methodologies for consumer testing of wheelchairs;
identification of obstacles and solutions for wheelchairs testing information disclosure at European level so as to ensure coherence with either the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards or the European Handynet information system;
definition of a preliminary agreement among the 6 European wheelchair testing institutes to circulate the test reports, according to common guidelines;
promotion of an infrastructure for ensuring that the expertise of the testing centres be exploited in the framework of the CEN standardization activities.

More than 200 paraplegic patients in Europe are now using advanced mechanical orthoses which have been developed or tested in the framework of this project and almost 20 hybrid systems (mechanical orthose s and FES) in Europe have been fitted with surface or implanted electrodes. A better insight has been achieved into the benefits of either functional or therapeutic walking in paraplegics and a clinical network for walking restoration has been created, including 22 centres in 5 countries.
This Concerted Action is addressed towards paralysed persons, who represent a high percentage among the physically disabled persons, although many other groups of disabled could benefit from the results of this Action. Most of those persons are paralysed as a result of spinal injuries (paraplegics, quadriplegics), of cerebral palsy, of neuromuscular diseases. 

Assistive technology for mobility restoration assumes great importance for the achievement of independence and better quality of life, for social integration, for access to job opportunities, school integration and social relationships. 

This Concerted Action took great advantages from the previous Concerted Action Evaluation of Assistive Devices for Paralyzed Persons, which explored all the ranges of technical aids and was able to identify the necessary priorities and the available multidisciplinary competences, stimulating initiatives and research in this field. The MORE aimed at a deeper insight into a more restricted scope which was given higher priority, ie mobility restoration. 

On the ground of: 
- the present state of technology and of the market 
- the priority needs of most paralysed persons in Europe 
- the research activities currently in progress in Europe the following areas were addressed: 

1. Walking Restoration in Paraplegics (WREP), including: 
mechanical devices 
functional electrical stimulation (with implanted or surface electrodes) 
hybrid systems (combining mechanical devices and FES) 
2. Technical Aids for Independent Mobility (TAIM), including:

To improve and to compare the different calculations codes, and to compare and compile experimental results.
The DECOVALEX project is composed in its first phase (October 1991 to September 1992) of two benchmark tests and one test case. The first benchmark test is a far-field study of a very fractured rock mass, the second one is a near-field study of a reduced number of fractures, and the test-case studies the real behaviour of a single fracture.
In its second phase, (October 1992 to September 1993), the project is composed of one bench-mark-test and two test-cases. The bench mark-test is a near-field study of a very fractured rock mass, the two test-cases respectively concern the behaviour of a single fracture, and the thermo-hydro-mechanical experiment of Fanay-Augères (uranium mine in France).
The aim of this experiment was to study the effects of the heating on fractured and unsatured granite rock mass, and to improve computer codes.
A rock mass has been modelled by a discrete approach, ie, by representing all the blocks and discontinuities. The informatical tools of the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de Paris have been adapted to the specific needs of water circulation in a set of fractures. Variation of the temperature and of the geometry of the joints have been taken into account for the calculation of the hydraulic parameters.

Two basic assumptions have been made: all the water flows take place only in the fractures and flows in the porosity of the blocks have been neglected; all the heat flows take place only in the blocks heat transfers through the water flows have been neglected.

A calculation without temperatures has been carried out, in order to validate the behaviour of joints in the case of a big mesh.
Work programme:

Bench-Mark Test No.1 is a 2-Dimensional modelling of the reactions, by THM processes, of a rock mass, (3000m x 1000m) to a radioactive wastes disposal about 500m deep.
The work programme for phase 1 is as follows:
- Selection of a discrete approach to model the rock mass.
- Selection of three 2-D codes based on the finite elements method: one for the mechanical calculation (VIPLEF), one for the thermal calculation (CHEF), and one for hydraulic (HYDREF).
- Addition to the HYDREF code of a joint-element taking into account both a thermo-hydraulic approach by a quadratic estimation of the density, the viscosity and the temperature of the fluid, and a hydro-mechanical approach by a quadratic estimation of the joint aperture.
- Coupling THM with CHEF, VIPLEF and HYDREF.
The work programme for phase 2 is as follows:
- development of tri-dimensional hydro-mechanical joint taking into account the thermal variations of the rock environment. The discontinuities are modeled using special joint finite elements,
- determination of principal characteristics of fractures for joint modelling,
- geometric definition of discontinuities allowing mesh of fractures by finite elements method: geometry, aperture, toughness, mechanical parameters of fractures,
- hydraulic description of fractures: channelling and connecting,
- thermo-hydrological coupling taking into account heat transfer by convection,
- search of tension behaviour laws in compression and in shearing taking into account the displacement of the rock matrix,
- search of the connection between stress-strain and mechanical aperture - hydraulic aperture for mechanical behaviour modelling.";402600;100000;;CSC;Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);FR;Association pour la Recherche et le Développement des Méthodes et Processus Industriels - ARMINES;FR;

This project intends to model the overall impact of gas production in the nearfield and in particular on the groundwater flow, the durability of engineered barriers and on the radionuclide migration. The wastes forms will include spent fuel, vitrified wastes, medium level wastes. The different rock formations envisaged are granite rock and salt.

2 reports have been prepared. The first corresponds to the data reference necessary for the development of the different models and particularly for the physical study of gas formation and transport. These data will evolve in function of the definition of the different scenarios and the repository concepts in the future months. The second corresponds to the listing of the different mechanisms governing gas formation. This analysis is only based on the bibliographic research and concerns the different types of waste and the different concepts considered.
Work programme: 

The project is divided into four stages: 

Description of processes
This step consists of identifying the mechanisms for gas formation in the different waste repositories considered in the project scenarios from bibliographic or experimental studies and establishing the common data for the development of the models and calculations. Analytical laws will be defined through this study to be integrated in the future modelling. 

Analyze of gas transport mechanisms
A listing of the main phenomena involved in transport in the near-field and the host-rock will be identified and studied. 

Modelling of the system
Modelling will be based on specific developments or on already existing models for the different repository conditions considered by each participant.

The EUROGAST research project focuses on a condition known to frequently precede the onset of gastric cancer: chronic atrophic gastritis (GAG). Two potential serum markers for CAG have become available: the concentration of serum pepsinogen (which decreases with increasing CAG) and the presence of serum antibodies to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The EUROGAST study looking at these 2 indicators in a variety of populations throughout Europe, selected for their variability in mortality from gastric cancer. Biochemical and metabolic differences between these groups are also studied, so as to determine the physiological processes that increase the cancer risk CAG sufferers. The second major aspect of EUROGAST is to assess the level of alkyl deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts in lymphocyte preparations from these populations. Several animal and human studies have demonstrated the formation of DNA adducts after carcinogen exposure. The level of alkyl adducts is thought to be indicative of exposure to alkylating agents, especially N-nitroso compounds which may have an aetiological role in gastric cancer. The study is attempting to estimate lymphocyte adduct formation in relation to gastric cancer risk in the populations studied and, within each population, to correlate adduct formation with the presence of serologically defined CAG.
In order to examine the epidemiology of chronic gastritis with atrophy and its association with gastric cancer, an ecological study, EUROGAST, was organised using these markers as a Concerted Action of the European Community Medical and Health Research Programme IV.

The original objectives of the EUROGAST study were:
1 To investigate the variability in serum pepsinogen A and C levels and the presence of serum IgG antibodies to H.pylori in representative samples of 12 geographically defined populations throughout Europe.
2 To examine the degree of association between the incidence and mortality from gastric cancer and the levels of serum pepsinogens and the prevalence of H.pylori antibodies.
3 To examine the extent and variability of the formation of alkyl-DNA adducts in peripheral lymphocytes and to relate the presence of adducts to gastric cancer rates and, within each population, to the presence of serologically defined atrophic gastritis (defined using pepsinogen levels).

The study was subsequently extended firstly by including additional populations in non-EC Europe, Africa, Japan and the US. This was to extend the range in cancer risk within the study populations. Secondly an additional objective became evident during the study:
4 To establish a biological resource of blood fractions, from different defined populations, collected, processed and stored under standardised conditions with accompanying socio-demographic data and comparable vital statistics about cancers of the stomach, colon, oesophagus, lung, breast (female) and prostate.";;;;CON;Imperial Cancer Research Fund;UK;;;

During the years a large number of fires have occurred at industrial installations. A great number of these fires were associated with storage of flammable liquids. However, a number of fires involving other chemical substances have also taken place. 

When the risks of a chemical store are to be assessed, a number of problems in connection with fire arise, such as: 
identification and quantification of the combustion products; 
dispersion of the combustion products; 
smoke plume chemistry; 
identification of toxic substances in the fire fighting water; 
and effects of fire fighting water on the plume dispersion. 

The objective of this programme is to gain substantial experimental data to allow improved modelling of the dispersion of toxic fire products and solid deposits from large fires in warehouses containing industrial chemicals. 

There are 8 main work programmes as follows. 
Identification of fire types; polymers, agrochemicals, metal ignitions and organic solvents. 
Microscale combustion experiments; burning behaviour, ventilated and unventilated. 
Cone calorimeter experiments; burning behaviour and analysis of fire effluent. 
Model scale sensitivity test to establish a correlation between bench scale toxicity testing and real fire combustion product generation. 
Particle characterization to relate concentration and size distribution to decomposition chemistry, gases and heat released and local conditions.

Many geotechnical and environmental applications, however, need information on physical and chemical properties of sediments. For their assessment, penetration measurements are being developed combining bore hole logging and coring techniques.
Two types of penetration devices were tested. The geotechnical module operates on the sea floor. Engine driven penetration allows a well controlled insertion of sensors into the sediment with a speed of 2 cm/s. Four parameters are acquired to a depth of 2 m: cone resistance, sleeve friction, excess differential pore pressure and wet bulk density. Furthermore, a 2 m long core can be obtained per launching.
The geophysical in-situ probe is designed for penetrations of 10 m to 20 m into soft sediments, depending on their stiffness. The following parameters are assessed: wet bulk density, natural gamma radiation, electrical resistivity and compressional wave velocities. The sensors are mounted at the lower end of a 10-20 m long penetration tube, which is loaded by a lead weight of 1.5 t at the upper end. The system is lowered by the ships winch to the sea floor, where it penetrates gravitionally into the sediment with a speed of about 10 cm/s. The depth is controlled by a pressure sensor with an accuracy of 1 cm. The data are transferred by cable to the recording and controlling units on board ship.
Results of test measurements in the Baltic Sea show good correlation of physical parameters with siesmostratigraphic units. The geophysical in-situ probe penetration system is a fast and effective tool to assess physical parameters under in-situ conditions. The time for one measurement is only 2-3 minutes.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
The knowledge of the physical parameters of marine sediments is important for the identification of sediment types and for the in-situ estimation of the rigidity of the sea-floor. The application of borehole logging methods in a miniaturised form, with probes driven into the sea floor gives direct access to the seismic velocities, electrical conductivity, natural gamma radiation and the U.Th.K - content of the sediment.  Other parameters such as porosity, density and permeability can be derived from the logging results. The dynamic shear modulus, which correlates with the shear strength, can be determined from the integrated compressional and shear wave experiment.  The shear modulus will also be estimated from tube waves. In combination with high resolution seismic profiling methods, the new tool gives access to a 3-dimensional mapping of structures and the in-situ properties of marine sediments.";;;;CSC;Christian-Albrechts-Universität Kiel;DE;"IFREMER - INSTITUT FRANÇAIS DE RECHERCHE POUR L'EXPLOITATION DE LA MER;Universiteit Gent;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA";"FR;BE;NL;IT";

It is thus directly related to the DRIVE objective to promote the development of cost-effective implementation strategies for the application of RTI systems both to road vehicles and to the roadside infrastructure.
The main objective of the research was to identify and describe actions and coordinations needed to assure the effective development and Europe wide introduction and functioning of road transport informatics (RTI) systems.

The following tasks have been carried out:
the organisation of international projects has been described as a background to the identification of areas and problems for standardisation;
a preliminary listing and description of legal areas and problems possibly affected by RTI systems have been made as a basis for a questionnaire on national and international problems with regard to laws and regulations;
areas for which standardisation could be considered have been identified and a methodological approach to analyse the requirements for standardisation has been proposed.
The identification of actions and coordinations are based on problems and difficulties expected in both short term and long term scenarios defined by a number of RTI systems. The description of these systems is being discussed with the concerned 'technical' DRIVE projects and checked with other related projects. National legal aspects have been surveyed by means of a questionnaire. Coordination is being made with other projects dealing with implementation aspects.

The Information Centre (IC) is seen by CHRISTlNE as a means by which the flow of information within the IRTE can be integrated and made available to all RTI applications.
Work has been conducted to define the characteristics and requirements of information centres, supporting traffic and nontraffic information flow, in an integrated network of traffic control centres and other road traffic informatics (RTI) applications, at national and transnational levels.
Recommendations have been produced for the following 10 main issues of traffic data exchange:
traffic data specification;
traffic data flow;
information centres;
urgency codes for message handling;
location referencing;
integration of traffic control centres (TCC) and information centres (IC);
integration of ATT system and ICs;
communication requirements;
field trials specifications;
recommendations for harmonisation.
These recommendations should allow the discussion with all the parties involved to achieve consensus, obtain the harmonisation of systems all around Europe and provide the basis for the efficient introduction of the integrated road transport environment (IRTE).
CHRISTINE follows two approaches to reach its objectives: Top-down and Bottom-up procedures: 

i) The top-down analysis aims to define the relative position of the IC in the IRTE and to define a model scenario where the traffic data interchange network (TDIN) would build up. 

ii) The bottom-up analysis covers the following areas of research: 
- Data flow in the IRTE: existing channels, TCC operator needs and options for future channels. 
- TCCs information requirements to support the control management objectives at all hierarchical levels: Databases. 
- Other RTls information requirements/information providers. 
- Definition of a data classification system and the data objects in the IRTE. Localization referencing system requirements for effective traffic data interchange. 
- Specification of the ICs supporting the storage, elaboration and distribution of traffic information in the IRTE. 
- Architecture of a Traffic Data Information Network. 

Key Issues 

Traffic data interchange is a multifaced problem which involves research in many fields: communications, systems engineering, computer sciences, modelling, standardisation, etc. CHRISTINE is concerned mainly with systems engineering, as it analyses the information requirements of the identified functions in the IRTE, belonging to existing and emerging applications and technologies. Communication is analysed from the user's needs (requirements) and TDIN's architecture points of view. In the standardisation field, CHRISTINE's main concern is to identify those areas where standardisation is needed, examining the current standards and common used practices.

This aim will be achieved by improvements in the following areas: 

- More attention to the needs, wishes and comfort of the pedestrian; 
- To develop communication with pedestrians and therefore increase their sense of responsibility; 
- To put at traffic engineers' disposal control equipment for this communication which will be more effective and more reliable (signals, detectors, algorithms).
The main aim of the research was to improve pedestrian safety and comfort at traffic lights by means of a more suitable system of pedestrian signals and traffic control.

The following developments have been completed:
a new pedestrian signal with a new message;
a waiting pedestrian detector based on a resistant rubber sensor;
a crossing pedestrian detector based on passive infrared technology;
an algorithm to manage the system which comprises pedestrian detectors and signals, vehicle detectors and signals and a traffic controller.

Tests including behavioural studies are in progress in 6 locations.

- Development of new strategies of pedestrian, signal and traffic control; 
- Research into and perfection of reliable pedestrian detectors and algorithms; 
- Full scale tests in the field of the complete set of tools developed and recommendation based on the evaluation tests.

23160;V1065;SIRIUS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;T515;FP2;Socio-political implications of RTI implementation and use strategies;;;;"The fundamental aims of the SIRIUS project are to identify sensitivities which positively or negatively affect the RTI implementation process and to identify the socio-political impacts of RTI adoption. Recommendations will be made taking into account these sensitivities and impacts for different actors and groups in the road transport environment.
The various institutional and political problems confronting the development of an integrated road transport environment (IRTE) have been investigated at an analytical level. At an empirical level, supply side and demand side sensitivities in respect of a number of specific technologies have been identified. Approximately 20 road transport informatics (RTI) applications, or potential applications, have been studied.
The problems associated with the development of an IRTE are as much a matter of organisational and other factors as they are a matter of technical or technological factors. Out of 3 scenarios formulated for European RTI implementation the supported network scenario is seen as the most appropriate mechanism by which the IRTE might best be implemented. The strategy used in this scenario is to arrive at integration by means of coordination and to accentuate information circulation. Therefore, it is recommended to develop decision support systems. A standardised database and an information exchange system will permit decision makers to access others involved in implementing or using related technologies.
One of the other recommendations is to adopt a problem oriented approach instead of a technology oriented approach. Research has provided evidence on a higher chance of implementation failure when supply and demand are insufficiently matched. A problem solving approach is the more appropriate institutional response to the advent of RTI. The existence of clear and well defined problems for which there are clear and well defined RTI solutions is likely to result in the readier implementation of RTI.
Successful implementation of RTI based policies requires an anticipatory approach to the sensitivities which are addressed by the introduction of new technologies. This task has a more general perspective given the broad range of possible RTI technologies and the many actors and groups concerned. The high degree of innovation has its direct and strong connections with fundamental social sensitivities. 

Although primary concern in the DRIVE programme is with the development of the tool on the one hand and with its intended use on the other hand, implementation of the technological innovation should not be monitored through the technical perspective alone. Speed of diffusion and penetration are in direct proportion to its socio-political acceptability. Furthermore, the particular characteristics of the environment in which technology is implemented must be recognized, for these are likely to effect the operation of the technology. 

In the first analytical phase the framework has been set and preliminary insights into relevant socio-political aspects of RTI introduction have been provided. Main elements for analysis were a review of literature on a range of strategies, a discussion with a panel of experts and an examination of particular projects adopted or rejected. The second phase gathers empirical evidence on sensitivities and impacts. The socio-political aspects will be identified mainly by way of interviews with actors on the supply side as well as the demand side of the process. Some 14 research sites have been selected. Here issues of sensitivity and social impact are thoroughly investigated. These sites covering several RTI areas are spread over 5 countries. 

The analysis is conducted on the basis of different scenarios concerning implementation and phasing of main RTI policies. These scenarios are formulated on the basis of input from related DRIVE projects. Continuous interaction with at least EURONETT, FRIDA and IMPACT is taking place. The analysis will lead to a diagnosis of the main issues associated with the introduction and implementation of RTI technology.

A set of methods and tools will be selected for evaluation of the protocols in pursuit of the final result, which will be an ISA with an associated set of proposals for standardised protocols.
The main aims of the research, entitled project VIC, were to examine a set of realistic applications of intervehicle communications, propose an integrated system architecture (ISA) and assess protocols to support these applications within the ISA.

The research project has defined the system requirements in terms of supported applications, nature and volume of data to be transmitted and type of communication (namely broadcast).

The global communication requirements have been identified and a communication architecture is being defined, taking into account real time constraints, which is suitable for integration in the integrated road transport environment (IRTE) and public networks.
The top-down approach, starting from a realistic set of applications, will be used primarily to establish global communication requirements. Network connection via the standard ISO/OSI-7 layer model format will be proposed and protocols corresponding to each layer will be defined; network exceptions, specific to VIC applications, will be detailed. In particular the issue of variable network topology will be studied on the basis of available radio channel characteristics. 

Methods and tools for formal validation and simulation of protocols will be defined, and further field tests, as well as pilot projects, will be prepared. Ultimately a set of proposals for communications standardisation will be established by means of these techniques and through close inter-project relations.

23166;V1064;UROP;;FP2-DRIVE 1;T330;FP2;Universal roadside processor;;;;"The main objective of the UROP project is to develop an open reference architecture for a multipurpose roadside system in an integrated RTI infrastructure. The architecture will describe the logical behaviour of independent building blocks and the interfaces between them. This architecture will serve as a hardware and software independent reference for the implementation of modular roadside systems.
Roadside processors must be flexible intermediary links between higher level control centres and the vehicles on the road. Depending on local requirements, roadside processors can be simple systems with few functionalities, or also highly complex systems with combinations of various peripherals and monitoring and control functions. The large number of roadside processors needed stresses the importance of a good design, for reasons of cost, ease of integration and maintainability.
Studies have been conducted in order to:
draw up general requirements for open, multipurpose roadside systems in an integrated road transport informatics (RTI) environment;
develop a hardware and software independent reference model for the development of basic system building blocks;
present a system implementation of a universal roadside processor (UROP) for a selected infrastructure.

Apart from information exchange between neighbouring roadside systems and traffic centres, roadside systems also exchange information with the next higher level and lower levels of the integrated road transport environment (IRTE). Roadside data flows, either via regional centres or directly, to national centres where the whole of the network can be monitored. From there traffic control data will eventually flow back to the roadside layer. Data also flows to vehicles in the lower layer, either via roadside processors from higher level systems or from the roadside systems themselves. Standardised referencing of roadside data, within the context of the whole road network will provide a flexible use of traffic data across the various levels of the IRTE.
The large number of Roadside Processors which will eventually be necessary stresses the importance of a good design for reasons of cost and maintainability. Proper mapping of system functions to basic building blocks will result in flexible systems for a range of applications. The basis for the implementation of such systems is a clear architecture, which, by a proper choice of standards for data and protocols, should survive the successive generations of computer and communications technology. At the same time it should be open-ended to allow for future applications to be included. 

The project started with a review on current sensor systems and RTI applications that are related to roadside systems. This review formed a basis for the definition of requirements for roadside applications. The next step was the analysis of the functional behaviour of the Roadside Processor; in this step the flow of data and control in the Roadside Processor was modelled and formally described. Further investigation on independent processors and storage will result in a modular architecture specification which is still independent of specific hardware and software technology. Applications in roadside systems should be independent of physical aspects of data communication networks. A communication architecture for a road network will be presented that will support multiple network topologies and will provide a uniform interface to roadside applications. The next steps in the project are to validate the architecture and to demonstrate its applicability by designing a prototype system based on selected technology. During this step also current in use national standards for roadside systems will be identified and described. Furthermore the project feels that the architecture may be applicable for urban systems as well, a special workpackage will investigate on this issue.

23161;V1066;PULSAR;;FP2-DRIVE 1;T509;FP2;Parking urban loading/unloading standards and rules;;;;"The PULSAR project goals are to obtain a tool to determine the traffic problems resulting from on-street parking and delivery access, to propose alternative evaluated strategies and to identify technical and legal modifications needed in the future for these new strategies.
The main aims of the research, entitled project PULSAR, were to obtain a tool to determine the traffic problems resulting from on street parking and delivery access, to propose alternative evaluated strategies and to identify technical and legal modifications needed in the future for these new strategies.

The following tasks have been carried out:
a survey of urban on street parking regulations throughout the EC and the state of the art in existing strategies;
building the socioeconomic model SUPERNOVA (street unloading/loading parking evaluations and reactions through numbering and organising vehicles algorithms) to evaluate parking and loading/unloading and the disruption caused to traffic, pedestrians and buses and to simulate the reactions of the parking/unloading systems when the parameters of different strategies are applied;
surveys in Paris, Birmingham, Lisbon and Barcelona; evaluation of the SUPERNOVA model in Paris, Lisbon and Birmingham.
This project focusses on the production of technical and legal guide-lines needed to adjust future strategies for on-street parking and loading/unloading control throughout the Community. The evaluation of any strategy has many aspects: most common are the effects on traffic flow, balance between waste of time and fluidity, degree of congestion of network, commercial consequences and competition with peripheral shopping centres, street layout, and behaviour of users (drivers and non-drivers). 

The question of planning is being addressed by PULSAR through the building of a specialised socio-economic model, which local authorities can use to forecast the effect of a parking/loading policy. 

PULSAR will test this model in selected areas of four European towns, measuring the effect of different strategies. 

PULSAR will also take into account the emerging RTI technologies for on-street parking control and equipment and will recommend on their utilisation in European cities. 

Finally, presuming that the development of RTI systems leads to an evolution of new control strategies in urban areas, PULSAR offers to aid the progress from existing to future strategies and to present realistic recommendations for the future.

17032;A 1039 - 8104 8304 8521;MURIM;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Multidimensional Reconstruction and Imaging in Medicine;;;;"The purpose of this feasibility study is to propose a framework and guidelines for a fully integrated computer-assisted analysis and intervention environment, based on multi-dimensional imaging (i.e. image data visualization and analysis) and knowledge information from different modalities. Such an environment would available for diagnosis, therapy -planning and resultant intervention.
This project was a preliminary step in the creation of a general framework for computer assisted medical intervention (CAMI) in health care. Neurosurgery was chosen as a testbed in this feasibility study. Attention was focussed on the application of computer assisted intervention planning and performing (ie medical robot intervention in neurosurgery).
To accomplish these tasks a fully integrated medical intervention planning and performing (MIPP) environment, consisting of a workstation based decision support system, linked to an intelligent robot control unit and the medical robot, is considered.
Health care surgery could be provided with a workstation based platform for:
knowledge based multimedia database management;
multidimensional image data processing, modelling, visualization, analysis and interpretation for decision strategies;
computer assisted medical simulation for intervention planning and performing.

Special attention will be paid to standardization and safety aspects of hardware and software components of the MIPP environment as well as to the accuracy and quality of the complex, 3-dimensional reconstructed, geometric models of the biomedical object.

The availability of user friendly interfaces coupled to powerful image processing workstations, which in turn can be connected (for example by local area networks) to various acquisition systems may induce new kinds of behaviour to the medical community. This will result in a new structure of medical knowledge and will have economic consequences on various health care systems.
During the study, the state of the art in each relevant area will be  appriased, and the research programme necessary to establish a European  implementation will be identified, together with the centres of  excellence within the Community    that are best with the centres of  excellence within the Community that are best placed to undertake this  work.

16972;V1005;PREDICT;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Pollution REDuction by Information and Control Techniques;;;;"The objectives of the project are (i) to establish environmental standards in consultation with all the relevant authorities throughout the EC and (ii) to develop a scheme for reducing environmental pollution in Central Business Districts through the use of traffic operation and control measures.
Within pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT), a multipath assignment model is used for assignment of traffic to the network. This is based on the stochastic assignment procedure developed by Dial. The algorithm assigns trips to all reasonable paths simultaneously in such a way that the resulting effect is identical to what would have been obtained had each path been assigned trips separately under certain choice probability assumptions. The assignment procedure can be used to select paths through the network which are environmentally optimal. The area under pollution control can cover the whole network or subnetwork. If the control area is a subnetwork, generally the model reduces significantly the congestion and the pollution of this area, trying at the same time not to increase the pollution at the periphery. The control area is defined by the link numbers of the network.
The accurate estimation of emissions from mobile sources needs a detailed representation of traffic flows. The functions of the traffic model within the PREDICT suite are fulfilled by TRANSYT. This has 2 main elements; a traffic model and a signal optimiser. The model represents traffic behaviour in a network of streets in which most junctions are controlled by traffic signals. The model predicts the value of a performance index for the network, which is a measure of the overall cost of traffic congestion, and is usually a weighted combination of the total amount of delay and the number of stops experienced by traffic.
The optimisation process adjusts the signal timings and checks, using the model, whether the adjustments reduce the performance index. By adopting only those adjustments which reduce the performance index, signal timings are successively improved until an optimum is reached. Output gives several measures related to overall traffic performance. These include total distance travelled, time spent on the network, and mean journey speeds over the network. Total delays and stops are also output, together with fuel consumption figures.
A prototype was made available on 25/08/92

The pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) emissions model, known as PREMIT, uses the output from the traffic model to calculate the quantities of various pollutants emitted by traffic travelling on the road network. PREMIT is a model which takes account of the amount of time spent by vehicles in various driving modes. It can also model emissions of any pollutant and allows the urban vehicle fleet composition to be defined by the user. The model has been developed with maximum flexibility in mind, and it can be easily updated with data that reflect the emissions characteristics of new vehicles. The PREDICT emissions model takes into account the proportion of time spent in various driving modes (cruise, acceleration, deceleration, idle) and hence the quantity of pollutants emitted in each mode. The model works on the basis that these modes are a consequence of stopping and starting at the intersections between each link. The vehicles which are delayed along a link are assumed to step through each driving mode. Vehicles accelerate off from an intersection and then reach cruise speed. When they get within stopping distance of a stop line or the back of a queue, the vehicles will then decelerate to a halt and idle within the queue.
The model can also incorporate data for a range of vehicle types which are considered to have different emission characteristics. Any vehicle type can be represented so long as data are available for the vehicle's emission rates across all driving modes and the proportion it makes up of the whole fleet for the network being modelled. This capability allows the modelling of different vehicle types, with and without emission reduction devices. The emissions model calculates the emission rates of pollutants for each link within the road network. The emissions model can accept traffic performance data from any source or traffic model, provided it is correctly formatted. Having calculated pollutant emission rates for each link within the network, the model generates an output file which contains parameters that can be used to give a direct assessment of environmental performance, or can be input to a dispersion model to calculate resulting pollutant concentrations.
A prototype was made available on 25/08/92

The dispersion model currently used in the pollution reduction by information and control strategies (PREDICT) model suite is PREDCO. This is essentially a microscale model, in which local pollutant concentrations are determined as a result of emissions on particular links and prevailing atmospheric conditions. The input data required by this model are the definition of the road network, the location of the receptor where the pollutants are measured, traffic flows and speeds, the wind speed and direction. The road network must be reduced to a set of straight line sections which are specified by the coordinates of their endpoints.
The wind speed is given in metres per second and the wind direction in degrees from grid north (ie a wind blowing from the north has a direction of zero degrees, from the east 90 degrees). To run the pollution prediction routine of the model, an input file containing link and receptor location coordinates must be present. Traffic flow and speed data and the estimated prevailing emission rates are passed to the dispersion model internally from the assignment and the emission model, respectively. Meteorological data are generally assumed to be constant across the network.

Strategy one, environmental optimisation of traffic signal settings, aimed to investigate a relatively low cost solution to the high pollution levels being encountered in some European cities. Overall, this strategy reduced pollutant emissions which arose when the manually optimised or nonoptimised network was optimised using TRANSYT. It also shows that changing the weightings between delays and stops would have had only a relatively small additional effect on overall pollutant emissions levels.
In modelling strategy two, pollution sensitive traffic rerouting, various percentages of compliance to the hypothesised transmission of information to vehicles were considered. For evaluation purposes, the particular scenario was examined in which 30 percent of vehicles complied with the guidance advice given. Emissions levels on the ring network within the case study area were then examined using the pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) model suite. This strategy produced reductions in the levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon emissions over the base case.
The modelling of the third strategy, introduction of clean vehicles, was again achieved using the PREDICT model suite. This was run initially with 10 percent of petrol cars having a catalytic converter. Subsequent model runs represented an increasing proportion of catalytic converters. The results obtained clearly indicated that the introduction of catalytic converters on all petrol cars looks to be a very effective way of reducing pollutant emissions within an urban area. If the emissions of other vehicle types in the fleet (in the case study area, diesel taxis and buses) were reduced then network emissions could be reduced even further. This strategy therefore promises a much higher and healthier standard of air quality within European cities in the future.
Strategy four, environmental area licensing, would involve restricting access to a defined central area of a c ity to vehicles fitted with a catalytic converter. Again, this strategy appeared to be potentially effective at reducing the pollutant emissions within the controlled area. The percentage of vehicles fitted with catalytic converters outside the controlled area had a small effect on the total emissions for the whole case study network.

Road traffic is currently a major contributor to overall air pollution levels experienced in urban areas. As traffic levels rise towards the end of this century, urban congestion is set to become an even greater problem in terms of its environmental effects. Many countries are therefore looking for ways to reduce and minimise these effects.
Potential solutions to traffic related pollution include use of new vehicle technologies and improved traffic control techniques. Within this framework, the pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) project was undertaken to assess the potential of new road transport informatics (RTI) technologies for pollution reduction. PREDICT focused primarily on developing alternative RTI-base control strategies and evaluating their effects on air pollution levels.
A number of RTI-based control strategies and schemes were developed within PREDICT to reduce environmental pollution in urban areas. These encompassed environmental optimisation of traffic signal timings, pollution sensitive traffic rerouting, introduction of clean vehicles and environmental area licensing. Each of the PREDICT control strategies was developed with particular environmental policy objectives in mind. These included reduction in pollution levels over a wide area, reduction in pollution levels within a defined city centre area and reduction in pollution levels at particular hot spots on the road network. Each of these was seen as a legitimate policy objective in the light of increasing concern over urban air pollution.
A major aspect of PREDICT was the development of a comprehensive model suite. This forms a powerful tool which can be used to predict and analyse the environmental effects of different traffic management measures and control strategies. The emissions model included in the suite represents a significant advance on previous models, with representation of traffic activity at the microlevel. The model suite was applied within th e PREDICT project to evaluate the effects and impacts of the 4 PREDICT control strategies. This showed that there is significant potential for use of road transport informatics (RTI) technologies in reducing air pollution. Effective control strategies can make use of RTI in conjunction with pollution monitoring and prediction systems, and can also incorporate use of vehicle emissions control technologies.
The results suggested that the most effective control strategies for reducing air pollution will combine traffic restrictions or demand management techniques with emissions reducing engine technologies. However, the cost and/or institutional barriers associated with such strategies are probably the greatest. Other strategies may be more appropriate in some cities, depending on the exact nature of the pollution problem and on local political acceptability considerations.

This will largely be based on modelling which will predict the pollution effects of various RTI strategies. Pollution monitoring systems will also be studied to develop and define monitoring plans and a `pollution advisory' tool which will give traffic controllers an overall picture of both environmental and traffic conditions on their road network. 
The consortium has already developed a model which calculates air pollution levels on the basis of traffic signal timing and route guidance systems amongst other things. The model will be refined and enhanced to include a capability within the vehicle emission sub-model for the separate representation of vehicles with and without emission reducing devices. After a review of the model specifications in the boarder context of the project, the model will be validated on the basis of historical data from a European city. 
The potential for the reduction of pollution levels will be assessed against all relevant RTI based traffic operations and control measures. The benefits of implementing a given control measure will be assessed in a European city, comparing its effects (including those on human health) with a base scenario representing the existing situation. New, more stringent, pollution standards will be recommended which should be feasible as a result of the introduction of RTI. 
At a later date the project will consider using real time data from the monitoring tool in a model describing the complexities of gas dynamics, air mass transport, urban topography and traffic flow. This tool would be used to generate detailed short term pollution forecasts.

The project is closely related to project T530 'Advanced Architecture for Diagnostic Medical Knowledge based Systems', though proposes a wider range of patient management and information retrieval techniques. 

Much of this architecture has already been successfully developed, and demonstrated in a series of advanced prototypes. These use a range of knowledge formalisms in several medical domains, and separate control knowledge from medical knowledge, as described in T530. Furthermore, methods for data acquisition; hypothesis generation and evaluation; explanation; reasoning under uncertainty, etc, have been formalised in a logical decision model, covering treatment and investigation as well as diagnostic decisions. A mixed-initiative user interface gives access to the whole knowledge base and all system functions, on demand. Substantial extensions of the T530 proposal are therefore possible. 
The project proposes to extend the prototype to cover additional medical areas and additional technical topics identified in T530, such as reasoning about temporal events and reasoning with physiological and anatomical information. In addition, the work addresses the design of very large KBSs - potentitally the whole of medicine. Participants will refine their model-based methodology for knowledge acquisition and in collaboration with prominent English and French medical publishers, investigate techniques and media for low cost delivery of large scale medical KBSs.

The main objective of the research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe (RACE) Open Services Architecture (ROSA) project is the definition of an open services architecture for integrated broadband communications (IBC) services and the application of that architecture to solve practical service creation and implementation problems. Objects are used as the basis for specifying and designing services for IBC. The ROSA Object Model (ROOM) has been designed so that telecommunication services can be described in an unambiguous way. The model consists of a set of concepts relating to abstraction, specialisation and composition, which are key features for constructing models. The development of the open services architecture for RACE is progressing through the use of a service specification framework (SSF) and a resource specification framework (RSF). General telecommunication objects have begun to appear and an attempt is being made at using these objects for service specification under the control of the ROSA methodology and the ROSA object model (ROOM). The ROSA architectural concepts provide support for the specification of open telecommunication services. The ROSA architectural rules constrain the application of the concepts by the service specifier and system designer. For example, the ROSA approach requires a consistent approach to telecommunication service management. Each telecommunication object includes a basic management object type and a service-specific management object type. Recipes provide robust solutions to well known problems. These are presented mainly in the form of object types. The recipes provided by the current version of the architecture include a Finder object type and a Basiclog object type. The deliberable, The ROSA Architecture, Release One provides more detailed material. The principal output of the ROSA project is an open services architecture, based on the object oriented paradigm, whose interfaces are non-propr ietary. The ROSA project is described in overview form, in The ROSA Handbook, Release one.
Technical Approach  

The ROSA project addresses open service architecture issues by providing a standardised architectural route which leads from the requirements for a service to its implementation. It achieves this objective by creating a common architectural approach, and a system-level object-oriented architecture for service software. Included in this framework are both the control and management aspects associated with telecommunications software.  

'Objects' are used as the basis for specifying and designing services for IBC.  The ROSA Object Model (ROOM) has been designed so that telecommunication services can be described in an unambiguous way. The model consists of a set of concepts relating to abstraction, specialisation, and composition, which are key features for constructing models.  

Key Issues  
. The presence of multiple network operators and service suppliers in the IBC.  
. Requirement for services tailored to the specific needs of customers.  
. The smooth introduction of new services, enabling interworking with those already existing.  
. A unified, object-oriented service specification architecture and strategy.  
. Greater accessibility to the service management component of the service.  
. Increased independence of the architecture and services from new and evolving technologies.  

Achievements  
The development of the open services architecture for RACE is progressing through the use of a services specification framework (SSF) and a resource specification framework (RSF).  General telecommunication objects have begun to appear and an attempt is being made at using these objects for service specification under the control of the ROSA methodology and the ROSA object model (ROOM).  

The ROSA architectural concepts provide support for the specification of open telecommunication services. Typical concepts are domains and transparencies. The ROSA architectural rules constrain the application of the concepts by the service specifier and system designer.  For example, the ROSA approach requires a consistent approach to telecommunication service management.  Each telecommunication object includes a basic management object type and a service-specific management object type.  Recipes provide robust solutions to well known problems.  These are presented mainly in the form of object types.  The recipes provided by the current version of the architecture include a Finder object type and a Basiclog object type.  The deliverable, The ROSA Architecture, Release One provides more detailed material.  

To fully exploit the ROSA architecture, a service designer must use the ROSA architectural components, the ROOM and the ROSA service specification methodology to create a new service.  The specification of the functionality is separated from the consideration of the implementation-oriented detail of a telecommunication service, as this is fundamental for an implementation-independent specification of a service.  

The principal output of the ROSA project is an open services architecture, based on the object-oriented paradigm, whose interfaces are non-proprietary. The ROSA project is described in overview form, in The ROSA Handbook, Release one.  

Expected Impact  
ROSA is stimulating a shift towards the object-oriented paradigm in other RACE projects.  A direct link has been established with the ESPRIT project Integrated Services Architecture (ISA) to influence CCITT (DAF), OSI (ODP) and OSI (Network Management Forum).  The overall message which ROSA has successfully presented is that the introduction of new (unplanned) services is potentially a very complex problem to solve, unless management aspects are an integral part of service creation and support.";;;;;British Telecom plc (BT);UK;"Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH;PTT Netherlands Research;TFL;France Telecommunication;Synergie;Ericsson Telecommunication;Architecture Project Management;Ericsson (UK) Ltd;Norwegian Telecommunication Administration;IBM France SA;Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni SpA;Fondazione ""Ugo Bordoni""";"DE;NL;DK;FR;SE;UK;NO;IT";
16954;V1017;BERTIE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Changes in Driver Behaviour due to the Introduction of RTI Systems;;;;"The goal of the project is to utilise a multi-disciplinary range of test tools to investigate the impact of RTI systems on driver behaviour. This project will concentrate on behaviour at the micro-level.
The problematic nature of assessing the impact of in vehicle transport systems (ITS) technology is rooted in the highly complex and integrated nature of the driving task itself. Driving may be described as an act of dynamic control which relies on highly proceduralised knowledge. This activity is not only dynamic but is probabilistic, the driver must be proactive and selective when seeking out relevant task information from the traffic environment. The problem for the project was twofold. Firstly, ITS systems may affect driving behaviour through any number of complex and subtle ways which are difficult to capture as objective, hard data. Secondly, techniques of data capture must be sufficiently sensitive to pinpoint those devices which could distract or reduce the capacity of the driver to safely control the vehicle.
The development of a conceptual framework describing driving behaviour was central to directing the technical aims of the project. The important aspect of the framework is the acknowledgement that driving is a primarily cognitive as opposed to a motor activity. Therefore usability may not be assessed solely within the simplistic terms of a stimulus response model (ie simply install a ITS device and observe overt changes in driving behaviour). It is essential to consider the more nebulous effects of technology on cognitive aspects of the driving task such as decision making and perception (ie at the strategic level). This covert category of data may only be captured via psychological techniques. Single technique approaches are liable to produce inaccurate or misleading conclusions. The strength of the multilevel approach is that it allows certain types of data to be cross-referenced to those obtained via other techniques.
A technical strategy of the project was to develop and validate a set of data capture techniques on the basis of the above framework through a process of test retest validity. In addition the project aimed to address the question of dat a capture environments (ie where to perform usability evaluations). This issue was examined via 2 parallel strands of experimentation, one to be carried out in a dynamic vehicle simulator and the other using instrumented vehicles on the real road.
Irrespective of data capture environments, the project intended to demonstrate via application how the data tools should be used as part of a usability analysis. Usability evaluation method and information were directed towards changes in driver behaviour at 4 levels: group perception and strategies (eg cultural norms), individual perceptions, attitudes and strategies, individual control behaviour and individual physiological responses. The first 2 levels produce qualitative, descriptive data which addresses issues of system acceptability. Whereas the next levels attempt to quantify those changes in driver behaviour in terms of ITS system safety and efficiency.
The project has developed a body of knowledge, a level of expertise and documented research facilities that will have a usefulness beyond the life of this particular project.

It was decided to concentrate on 2 in-vehicle applications, route navigation systems and hands free car phones. Whilst the emphasis of the project was the testing of data capture tools through hands on experience of usability evaluation, it was necessary for the project to undertake a number of background, literature reviews. 2 of these attempted to formulate driver information needs and the impact of man machine interaction (MMI) with route navigation technology, on the basis of cognitive models of human information processing. Another defined the requirements for task complexity in real road field trials. A fourth provided a critique and summary of psychophysiological investigation of driver behaviour. This research lays particular emphasis on the pragmatic constraints and problems of using these measures within the context of a real road trial. These reviews provided vital background material for the real road trials on route navigation.
The development of a multilevel approach to system evaluation took the form of 2 parallel strands of investigation, real road trials and dynamic simulator trials. The project performed 5 studies investigating changes in driver behaviour due to hands free carphone use. 2 of these studies were performed on the real road and the rest in the dynamic simulator.
Normal driving (ie driving in silence) was compared to driving and performing a verbal secondary task via either a hands free carphone or to an experimental stooge sat in the passenger seat. This approach was particularly use for the detection of different patterns of braking behaviour. This study was also notable in that the psychophysiological variable (in this case, mean heart rate) was demonstrated to differentiate between the two verbal secondary tasks.
Whilst real road studies were directed toward detecting subtle changes in driver behaviour, the dynamic simulator provides a safe environment for the testing of driving performance. A simulator study has been carried out where both the complexity of the route layout and a secondary carphone task were included as experimental variables. This study also tested driving performance by introducing a visual target to cue braking reaction. The study revealed a detriment in braking response time, a reduction of speed and an increase of lateral position when using a hands free carphone. It was demonstrated that system intrusion on the driving task was a subtle phenomenon more apparent in braking reaction, psychophysiological stress and subjective mental workload rather than characteristics of the driving task per se.
The second part of the behaviourial work concentrated on the impact of in vehicle information systems, in particular, route navigation systems. Both investigations took the form of real road trials. An experimental comparison between a complex map display and a simple text display for the purpose of route navigation was examined. Drivers' visual behaviour, subjective techniques and psychophysiological measures were particularly revealing.

This work area concentrated on potential users' attitudes towards in-vehicle intellegent transport systems (ITS) technology in terms of system utility and efficiency, the training requirements of ITS systems and how these systems may be targeted at demographic groups of the driving population (ie elderly drivers).
These types of research findings occasionally contradicted the results of the behaviourial data. These kinds of inconsistencies between data types emphasised the need for a multilevel approach to usability evaluation. This finding led to a further investigation of the benefits associated with the LISB system for 10 sample commuters. The commuter driver represents one group within the driving population. It was important for the project to acknowledge that driver needs are not homogenous and to differentiate between the needs of individual groups of prospective users. This has consequences for the market impact and acceptability of ITS technology for the driving population as a whole. Route guidance was only necessary when journeys were fluctuating and/or involved those road sections highly affected by accidents or unpredictable congestion. In other words, the commuter drivers who participated in the study found the LISB to be of limited usefulness. The training needs associated with the introduction of ITS technology were investigated. The training needs which might be required by elderly drivers for the use of ITS were also examined. The report concluded that ITS facilities exist which may be used to counter the psychomotor deficiencies of elderly drivers. However this facility should not be used in order to 'police' or actively discriminate against the elderly as a target group.
Five teams of researchers will cooperate in a programme designed to collect a range of data to present a complete picture of driver behaviour that will be of use to RTI designers and to legislators. It is intended to engage in laboratory based experimentation using a full-scale driving simulator, and also to equip a mobile test bed facility for collecting data on drivers control actions and driving performance. This data will be enhanced by objective and subjective measures of driver stress via a combination of physiological monitors. Psychological techniques such as verbal protocols and structured interviews will also be used. Additionally sociological data will be gathered on the impact of existing infrastructure supported route guidance and localized parking information systems. Data on the strategies adopted by drivers using these systems will be fed back to the teams operating the simulator and test vehicle facilities. Simulations of particular aspects of RTI systems can then be developed. These will be evaluated in terms of usability (efficiency and acceptability) with reference to safety and models of driver behaviour and accident causation. Initially the RTI systems will be tested individually, then later as the simulations become more sophisticated they will be tested in combination.

17057;A 1001 (8422);AVICA;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Advanced Video endoscopy Image Communication and Analysis;;;;"The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of introducing image analysis techniques for macroscopic images issued from instruments such as endoscopes, colposcopes ... in the current medical practice. This will be performed by investigating design requirements for dedicated workstations to be placed in generalist office on one hand and specialist office on the other hand. 
More precisely the objectives are : 
- to analyze current medical practice concerning the diagnosis of endoscopic type images and to establish common reference criteria for grading these images ; 
- to study the applicability of advanced image analysis techniques to extract valuable features to correlate with pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions ; 
- to determine the requirements for introducing dedicated workstation as well as video-endoscopy image communication facilities between generalist and specialist ; 
- to integrate existing modules to build a demonstrator system to familiarize clinicians with advanced imaging tools ; 
- to develop a plan for a concerted action research to design effective systems for video endoscopy image communication, analysis and interpretation.
!!The current phase of AIM has permitted research work to be initiated on the evaluation of imaging techniques in the field of endoscopy. It is intended to set up a research and development project to build systems to be used in pilot sites for a multicentric evaluation in the 2 domains of application covered by the current project mass prescreening for gynaecology, diagnosis and therapy follow up for urology.
In gynaecology, the current project strengthens the precision, reproducibility and reliability of diagnosis.
Concerning urology the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is periodically informed about the progress of the project.

The hardware architecture developed as part of the project has already encountered a great interest particularly from people involved in other fields of medical imaging, as one of the highest performance transputer based system for colour imaging applications.
Cancer is the second explanation of mortality in Europe and the resulting morbidity is very important due to the metastases associated to most cancers along with the aggressivity and the amount of therapeutics in case of advanced cancers. For years prescreebing has been and will continue to be a key factor in the success of therapy by applying to lower grade tumors. Today, physicists highly desire to detect a cancerous or even precancerous lesion without tissue sample taking. Fibroscopy and more recently Video Endoscopy appear to be a promising technique for non invasive observation in the field of gynaecology, urology, gastroenterology, ... Thus may be detected at the macroscopic level small lesions which may evolved into cancerous lesions. In order to compensate for gynaecologist subjectivity and to assist some phase of the diagnostic process, image analysis could be introduced and lead to a significant overall improvement of mass pre-screening. This shows the interest of associating numerical image processing and video endoscopes. In order for mass pre-screening to be effectively achieved, image acquisition has to be performed by non specialists. Thus setting communication facilities not only between specialists within the hospital network but also between generalists and specialists is a key factor. 
Main Deliverables : 
 The consortium integrates clinicians using fibroscopes, scientists working in the field of Image Analysis and its application to Medicine, as well as industrial developers involved in the design of instruments dedicated to the medical field or in the design of parallel computing architectures.

16964;V1007;SOCRATES;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;An RTI System Based on Cellular Radio for Traffic Efficiency and Safety;;;;"The roadside-to-vehicle communications necessary for DRIVE applications could be provided by existing or planned cellular radio systems. This technique could provide a very cost effective communications infrastructure, but at present its capabilities and limitations are not understood in detail. In particular it is widely believed that the capacity of such systems is too low. Studies by one of the consortium members have shown a way to overcome this problem by the use of a single common downlink and a single multiple-access uplink. In this way cellular radio, particularly GSM, can provide a high capacity duplex link without unduly loading the radio network. 
Among the most important DRIVE applications are route navigation and driver information. This project concentrates on the use of cellular radio as the communications link for these purposes.
SOCRATES is a multinational study investigating the use of cellular radio for a complete system of road transport informatics (RTI), including dynamic route guidance and many other applications.
The main applications considered are:
dynamic route guidance;
advanced traffic control;
parking management and information systems;
fleet management;
public transport management and information systems;
hazard warning;
emergency calls;
emergency paging;
automatic debiting;
driver information;
data for traffic management and traffic planning.

The overall concept is based on the collection, storage and processing of road traffic information within traffic control centres, or SOCRATES information centres. 2-way information flow between vehicles and roadside infrastructure is essential to inform drivers via their in car units and to collect real time traffic data from the vehicles. The approach adopted is based on the use of a common downlink and a single, multiple access, uplink. Cellular radio can provide a high capacity duplex link necessary for the integrated road transport environment (IRTE) without unduly loading the radio network. The first year of the project confirmed the feasibility of the approach initially suggested to overcome the supposition that the capacity of cellular radio systems for RTI purposes would be too low. During the second year the concept was demonstrated, on street, in the Netherlands and work developing a major test site in Gothenburg has progressed well.
The main topics of the project are the use of cellular radio for high capacity duplex links to carry information, the dynamic updating of in car navigation aids to provide interactive route guidance and other traffic related applications of duplex radio links.
The work will demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic route guidance systems based on cellular radio; show that the proposed system can support other applications such as hazard warning, emergency calls, automatic vehicle location, road pricing, hotel/parking status, etc; quantify the capacity of the system in terms of numbers of users; show how the developed technology can be used in simplified user equipment; provide computer simulations of the data processing, information flows to and from the vehicles, and the navigation system; equip a test site in Gothenburg and use laboratory models and prototypes to verify and validate the theoretical predictions; make preliminary recommendations for a coherent system with route guidance and other applications supported by cell ular radio.

17054;A 1011 (8324);COVIRA;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;COmputer VIsion in RAdiology;;;;"The COVIRA project (COmputer VIsion in RAdiology) aims at a substantial improvement of the quality of computer assistance in the clinical Neurosciences by providing a fundamental image interpretation tool which is a prerequisite for efficient computer assistance in neuroradiological diagnosis, in radiation therapy planning and in stereotactic neurosurgery. 
Experiments have been carried out on computer vision in radiology. The prime result of the project is the hardware and software specification of a system for knowledge based interpretation of cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images as a means of computer assistance in diagnostic radiology, radiation therapy planning and stereotactic neurosurgery. This specification is based on demonstrated results from prototypical implementations and an analysis of the state of the art and of the clinical requirements. Image segmentation and interpretation results were obtained for a set of test images of tumour patients selected by medical experts from the above fields. For each patient slice, two MR spin echo images were available. For image segmentation, results were obtained for 3 schemes: one using a Canny edge detector followed by a smooth patch fitting for region finding, another using a region detection according to Nagao/Matsuyama and a Marr-Hildreth edge detector based on one of the echoes to guide region merging, and a third scheme using a multiscale approach to edge detection. The image interpretation results were based on a case model representation of clinical, anatomical, MR-Physics, and tissue parameter knowledge. Results were obtained for 2 schemes: one using a fuzzy clustering approach providing a fuzzy segmentation and a subsequent fuzzy relational matching step, and another using a blackboard approach based on the classical low, middle and high level of processing, allowing for a dynamic control with feedback and backtracking mechanisms. The results were comparatively evaluated by medical experts based on criteria of clinical usefulness.
By involving extensive expert knowledge which is represented and used in the system, a significant amount of consultation time between radiologists, neurologists, oncologist and neurosurgeons can be saved resulting in improved cost-performance in clinical decision making. In the Exploratory Action AIM, the COVIRA project will result in a specification of a system suitable for clinical use. Such a system is to be set up within an AIM main phase activity. 
The project proposed here addresses workplan item T550, 'Medical Image and Signal Interpretation, Pattern Recognition' and is related to workplan items T510 (Reasoning from Medical Databases), T530 (Advanced Architecture for Diagnostic Knowledge Based Systems) as well as T545 (Prototype Implementation for Medical Consultation Systems). 
The low level image processing approach claims generality with respect to most classes of medical images, whereas the symbolic processing at a higher level draws upon four knowledge sources relating to the domain of cranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of patients with brain lesions : Anatomical, clinical, statistical (MR tissue parameters) as well as Physics (MR Scanning) knowledge. 
The knowledge sources and a case model representation will be used by all partners. Furthermore, the clinical participants, representing the potential application areas (oncology, stereotactic neurosurgery and diagnostic neuroradiology) will select a number of representative clinical cases to be processed by all partners to evaluate the interpretation results against professional 'manual' interpretation performance. 
In accordance with the objectives of T550, the project will 'identify the requirements for low to intermediate level processing of medical images' and extend to high level processing and interpretation. For this purpose low level processing algorithms will be programmed in 'C' with a division of tasks, and integrated into different control structures to be pursued in parallel. These will be rated at the end of the project with regard to their performance for the standardized input data in order to arrive at a specification for an optimum system architecture to be realized in the expected AIM main phase. 
These control structures include a blackboard approach with heuristic search and backtracking strategy, which makes use of a rule based 'integration of primitives', and an approach for information maximization using an iconic fuzzy set representation of organs of the body. The implementation will be object oriented in 'Common LISP'. For intermediate level processing, use of massive parallelism will be evaluated. 
Based on these parallel approaches (as recommended by CEC for the initial work), the project will relate to the further objectives of T550 by 'demonstrating medical image interpretation results via a prototype system' and finally by 'making recommendations with respect to possible further activities'. The potential impact on clinical decision making will also be investigated. 
The consortium partners have substantial experience in all above aspects. 
In order to maximize probability of success, the project has been restricted to the MR imaging modality and to the evaluation of organ structures, neglecting the fact that the envisaged clinical application may also call for an investigation of the more complex vascular structures in the brain, which are likely to be the subject of other AIM projects. The project therefore has allocated an activity to the exchange of information with such projects.

16936;V1038;DACAR;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Data Acquisition and Communication Techniques and their Assessment for Road Transport;;;;"The objective of this project is to review, analyse, develop and demonstrate basic data acquisition and communication techniques for use in RTI systems. To evaluate and assess the suitability of the techniques a regime of continuous assessment will be applied.
The DACAR project focuses its efforts on the communication between vehicles and the road transport infrastructure (RTI) infrastructure. DACAR aims to assess the facilities offered by different communication techniques. 5 different types of communication techniques were envisaged. Radio sensors, infrared, microwave and cable transmission.
After an initial preliminary phase of work, which included work on sensor systems and radio systems, the project now concentrates on the following areas: inductive cable systems, infrared communications (850 nm) and millimetre wave microwave communications (60 GHz). All of these techniques are essentially local in character, (ie vehicle to vehicle (except cables)), or vehicle to some sort of beacon or local communications node, as opposed to the wider area, usually public network based systems. This technical work started with a desk based state of the art and fundamental review of feasibility. Now the teams are moving on to the fabrication of prototypes for the development and support of project results by test and demonstration of equipment, designed especially for the DACAR project.
The subproject concerned with the assessment technique, having established an outline assessment methodology, will refine the technique to increase its utility to the DRIVE community (ie to assess any techniques or combination thereof) and provide a feedback mechanism to the technical subprojects in order that they may be consistent in their activities.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The aim of the research was to devise guidelines for the design of a digital transmission system to be used with road transport informatics (RTI) systems and to provide an assessment methodology for those transmission systems. In fact, different techniques (eg microwave, infrared and inductive cable) were investigated in order to design a data transmission system for a specific RTI application. This research deals only with telecommunication issues although a full assessment of transmission techniques will taken into account a number of aspects of a political, economical and social nature.

Technically, a simplified subalgorithm has been extracted from the overall assessment procedure, and the gap existing between the technical description of proposed systems and the technical description of potential RTI applications has been demonstrated. The work attempted to devise of a common within which each transmission technique could be compared. In this way a technique independent technical description has been achieved.

The aim of the research was to investigate the potential of infrared (IR) communication techniques for use with road transport informatics (RTI) systems. The technology has several advantages. It is simple, has a low cost and a wide range of applications and can be easily integrated into existing car devices. Besides this, the infrared frequency range is not yet fully utilised and the technology can be duplicated at multiple locations. The main contribution this research to the field of infrared road vehicle communication is in the use of vertical (continuous) transmissions which form a basic system allowing several messages to be transmitted at the same time. The study included various types of road vehicle communication links which were developed and tested. Tests were carried out under laboratory conditions and on the Valeo test track in Mortefontaine near Paris. There were 5 types of tests:
beam qualification;
dynamic tests;
lane determination;
trials in changing weather conditions;
measuring the limits of the data link.
The purpose of the tests was to show that IR can be used to transmit short or long messages, during the passage of a vehicle under the beams at a maximum speed of 180 kilometres per second. It is possible to transmit messages from and to the roadside at transmission rater higher than 600 kilobytes per second. If it is necessary to transmit more bits, combinations of several beacons are possible. IR was found to be a good medium for dedicated short range vehicle beacon communications (DSC).
The techniques considered are: sensors as data sources, radio systems, cable systems, microwave links and optical communications. 
After a review and analysis of these techniques, a first global evaluation will be made of the technical and economic aspects of the different techniques. The economic assessment and the dissemination of the results to other DRIVE projects will be an important element of the projects work and supported using appropriate tools. 
Eight months after its start the project will recommend which techniques justify further investigation in terms of their applicability and suitability for RTI. 
The selected techniques will be further analysed, developed, tested and demonstrated, if appropriate. The evaluation and assessment of the environmental, implementation, technical and transmission aspects will be performed in parallel to the investigations into the techniques and will result in a technical assessment of the techniques to be used for RTI.

17042;A 1029 (8216);INFORM;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;INFORmation Management and Decision Support in High Dependency Environments;;;;"The project is concerned with the development of advanced information systems in hospital High Dependency Environments (HDE). These include Intensive Care Units, Coronary Care Units, Neonatal Units, Burns Units, Operating and Recovery Rooms, and other specialized areas. The distinguishing feature of the HDE is the very large amount of data that is collected through monitors and paper records about the state of critically-ill patients. With the development of a greater variety of monitors and the collection of more clinical data, there is a 'data overload' which can only be solved effectively with the use of information technology.
A project has been set up to develop, evaluate and implement a new generation of information systems for use in a hospital High Dependency Environment (HDE). Such environments include intensive care units, neonatal units, burns units, operating and recovery rooms, and other specialized areas. The proposed system will integrate decision support with on line, off line and observed patient data and, in addition, will incorporate and integrate unit management features. A functional specification has been produced in the exploratory phase of the project, and this has been achieved by dividing the project into the following 4 main components: 
conceptual modelling of the HDE; 
evaluation of existing HDE information systems; 
development of a novel software architecture using a knowledge based systems methodology, and based on a critical review of knowledge based systems applied to the HDE; 
monitoring of appropriate leading edge technological developments, and of current and emerging standards. Activities relating to both clinical patient management and unit management have been modelled using a modern structured analysis methodology; process models were described with dataflow diagrams, and data models with entity relationship diagrams. Key and difficult areas in clinical decision making have been identified; an important aspect is the integration of clinical decision support for these areas into the information system through a layered architecture. The lower layers are concerned with monitoring and alarming and the higher levels with patient assessment and therapy planning. It was apparent from the evaluation of current systems in HDEs that these are not designed in such a developed and integrated way as to yield their full potential. The user interface is also crucial to a system's success. The system must reflect the needs and working practices of its users, and the highest priority will be given to these aspects throughout its design, development/prototyping and implementation phases.

An integrated approach has been taken to the problem of a multimodal organ modelling system (MMOMS) based on an in depth analysis of current and future requirements, as well as the practical feasibility in terms of visualization, hardware and software. This resulted in a unified concept for a future multimodal imaging system. Studies were confined to investigations of the brain. The specific tasks addressed were: 
clinical requirements; 
evaluation of digital brain models, vascular and tissue; 
technical requirements for visualization; 
algorithmic and architectural framework of the system; 
commercial considerations for a MMOMS workstation. A literature study was undertaken of clinical problems concerned with lesions requiring multimodal imaging for diagnosis and follow up, and clinicians interviewed. The project included a workshop. The investigation of appropriate data structures for representing vascular information resulted in the development of a hierarchy suitable as a common basis for efficient multimodal registration, reconstruction and display. A comprehensive survey of current algorithms identified those suitable for use in a MMOMS workstation. The work included an assessment of the importance of the ability to incorporate knowledge based image processing techniques. A preliminary assessment of the computational requirements of the essential algorithms has been performed and a quantitative assessment of registration algorithms included. Cost benefit factors have been considered, and promising candidates for future target systems identified. The review of all clinical and technical requirements resulted in a general MMOMS configuration consisting of both basic and application specific functions. The basic MMOMS functions would consist of a kernel for registration, a 3-dimensional rendering, simple displays of aligned slice data and image merging, and of an environment providing standard interfaces to communication networks and to hospital information systems.
The Exploratory Phase of the project will set out functional requirements. The functional requirements will be based on 4 components : 
- conceptual model of the HDE ; 
- evaluation of existing HDE information systems ; 
- development of a novel software architecture using knowledge-based systems (KBS) methodology and based on a critical review of KBS applied to the HDE ; 
- monitoring of leading-edge technological developments, including networking, databases, human-computer interfaces, knowledge-based systems and monitoring instrumentation. 
The conceptual model will have two components : a patient-related information model and a department-related cost model. The patient-related model will identify key integration of clinical decision support for these areas into the information system through a 'layered' architecture. The lower layers will be concerned with monitoring and alarming and the higher levels with patient assessment and therapy planning. We will determine the functionality of the different layer and how these should be interconnected. 
The Exploratory Phase will conclude with the publication of a report detailing the information requirements for the ICU and proposing a functional specification for an integrated architecture with decision support. In the Main Phase, such a system will be developed and its effectiveness evaluated. Ultimately, the system will be developed commercially for the European and international markets. 
The project will be guided by a panel of leading European clinical experts in the field of HDE.

16971;V1004;DREAM;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;A Feasibility Study for Monitoring Driver Status;;;;"The project is concerned with assessing the feasibility of developing a practical method for determining the status of the driver. This involved conducting an extensive review of the current state of the art of determining driver status and performing demonstration experiments to show the feasibility of a multiple approach. In general, the fundamental capabilities for driving and the factors which lead to reductions in these capabilities were indicated, so that methods to register the level of these capabilities could be developed. It is hoped that this work will lead to the development of a reliable method for monitoring a driver's status, which is unobtrusive, economical and technically feasible.

The primary objective of the research was to demonstrate that it would be possible to develop a device capable of monitoring the state of a vehicle's driver unobtrusively. A review of the state of the art showed that most of the essential conditions for building such a device are already satisfied.

A series of experiments was carried out to demonstrate the existence of interrelationships between the state of the driver, his or her driving performance and the driving environment. A variety of techniques was used, involving laboratory, simulator and field trials examining various aspects of driver status and performance using primarily psychological, physiological, environmental and vehicle handling measures. The results of the experiments show that driving performance is not to be conceived as a simple and unitary phenomenon which can be established reliably by a single measure.

A number of unobtrusive in vehicle measures were identified which provide reliable indices of changes in the state of the driver. On the basis of the work done and future research in this field, it will be possible to specify a driver monitoring device. It is proposed that the device itself should operate on the basis of a neuronal network, enabling the system to cope with a multitude of signals adaptively in real time.
The study will have two main components: 
- a survey of the state of the art 
- a series of demonstration experiments 
The state of the art survey report will be a detailed review of all procedures used to assess driver performance for whatever purpose. The demonstration experiments should produce coherent results using the same parameters but a variety of different methods. Three aspects of the demonstration experiments are particularly important: 
- to compare alternative methods against each other, 
- to demonstrate the necessity for, and the feasibility of, a multiple sensor monitoring device, 
- to describe any measurement techniques that need to be developed.

16946;V1029;RDS-ALERT;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;RDS Advice and Problem Location for European Road Traffic;;;;"This project seeks to establish internationally accepted standards in RDS-TMC (Radio Data System - Traffic Message Channel) location coding, messages and message management and to obtain a real consensus among broadcasters, national traffic authorities and manufacturers through a liaison group structure with EBU, ECMT and national traffic authorities. This structure will permit the consistent operation of RDS-TMC throughout Europe. The project includes the development of both broadcast and in-vehicle test procedures and equipment.
The advice and problem location for European road traffic (ALERT) protocol specifies driver information messages and defines the message list, its structure and content, and its presentation to the driver. Traffic message control (TMC) messages are language independent and can be presented in the language of the user's choice. Standard messages provide the following 5 basic items of explicit, broadcast information:
event description, giving details of the weather situation or traffic problem, for example, and its severity;
location, indicating the area, highway segment or point where the source of the problem is situated;
extent, identifying the adjacent areas, segments or specific point locations also affected by the incident;
duration, giving an indication of how long the problem is expected to last;
diversion advice, showing whether or not drivers are recommended to find an alternative route.

Optional information can be added to any standard message using one or more additional data groups.

The research aimed at establishing internationally accepted standards in radio data systems (RDS) traffic message channel (TMC) coding, format and operation for use as part of a road traffic information system. Within the research, current proposals for single sequence and multisequence messages were reviewed and evaluated in order to reach a starting consensus for experimental evaluation. The standard protocol for approval had to be comprehensive, to ensure that all required locations and messages could be coded, flexible, to deal with the situations existing in many different countries and to allow the system to adapt to future changes, efficient (ie using a minimum necessary number of bits).

The main points to emerge were:
at the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) recommended RDS deviation level of \/- 2 kHz, RDS TMC appears to be viable as a means of conveying traffic information;
at lower RDS deviations reception reliability is reduced, although it may be possible to provide a useful service;
TMC messages should be kept short so that the majority of messages can be encoded as single groups;
message repetition is the preferred form of error correction at the transport level;
in multigroup messages no advantage is gained by transmitting the separate elements of a message contiguously in time;
no false messages were detected when message validation depended on 2 or more message transmissions.

The radio data system (RDS) is a means of broadcasting digital information by using some of the spare capacity available in the existing frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting system. RDS provides a silent, digital channel which can be added to any FM radio station. A primary objective of this research was to bring together all the national traffic messages developed to date to establish an agreed international set. The research led to a protocol for a traffic message channel (TMC) and a RDS TMC structure offering the flexibility needed for covering a full range of European traffic situations, while retaining the potential benefits of single group messages for the majority of actual events. The protocol increased the efficiency of the message coding. In conjunction with revised location codes, it allowed the great majority of messages to be broadcast using a single RDS group. The few multigroup messages containing additional, detailed information would be compatible with the recommended one group structure, through the use of virtually identical fields in the first group.

A standardized system for providing detailed up to date traffic information to motorists is paramount in an integrated road transport environment to assist in solving growing congestion problems. The ability to provide this information in a language of the driver's choice would enhance still further effectiveness of such a system. The research carried out in the RDS ALERT project addressed the above issues of standardization. A European standard for transmitting traffic messages using the radio data system traffic message channel (RDS TMC) has been developed. RDS TMC will permit a quantum jump in traffic data dissemination into the vehicle by several orders of magnitude over conventional spoken warnings on the radio. By linking TMC to on board navigation systems, an additional tool will be created for direction and guidance of traffic movements.

In developing a European TMC standard, both technical and political considerations were taken into account. These included the quality of available data, the needs as perceived by broadcasters and traffic experts, and the technical limitations of the RDS broadcast medium. Field trials were carried out to examine RDS reception across Europe and a diverse range of conditions were encompassed. The results have been used to evaluate each TMC protocol element in order to refine and optimize the final standard.
The technical approach comprises the following stages: 
- identification of traffic-related message content together with associated structures, protocol and message management techniques; 
- the carrying out of mobile RDS reception tests to gather data on error-statistics, especially in areas of severe multipath interference; 
- the computer evaluation of the error-statistics to establish an empirical model; 
- the establishment of a standard interface specification for the transfer of TMC data to other traffic-related technologies. 
The project is subdivided into the following workpackages: 
- Review and evaluate progress to date in achieving consensus 
- Define and establish liaison group structure 
- liaise with interested parties 
- develop, discuss and finalize location codes 
- review message repertoire and propose input methods for broadcasts 
- define assessment criteria and scenarios

Tested technology categories are reported here below: 

1. Computer conference. 2. Televideo conference. 3. Direct Broadcasting by Satellite (DBS). 4. Techniques for redundancy reduction in television images. 5. Implementation of suitable equipped and organized teaching classroom. 

The workshop main goal will be the creation of a permanent meeting point for different operators (hardware and educational software manufacturers, teachers etc.) coming even from geographically far away regions, with carefully selected users in view of a first experimental stage and the implementation of training packages based on a intensive use of advanced information technologies. 

The workshop organization structure will be based on a technology area manager, generally coming from the partner with most experience in this field. Experts from different organizations, including sub-contractors, will then participate in each workpackage, for a cross-fertilization of knowledge and skills. 

This workshop project mainly meets the objectives of action line No 3 of the Delta programme. 

Attention will be given to the finalization of a conceptual pedagogical reference frame (action line 1) and the use of satellite and television and broadcasts with emphasis upon the needs of a mobile labor force in Europe, both skilled and professional, and the related language problems. In this connection consideration will be given to both the need to develop foreign language skills to follow continuous education/training in another language whilst located in another memberstate. 

Workshop activities will then be extended to other areas covered by the Delta programme, through connections with other Delta contracts at European level. The workshop will thus be 'open' also from this point of view.";;;;;Tecnologia Energia Ambiente Materiali Srl;IT;"ABSIS;Consorzio per lo Sviluppo dell'Elettronica e l'Automazione;Università degli Studi di Genova;AF Forum - Società Autosport;HENLEY MANAGEMENT COLLEGE;JUTLAND TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE;CH COMMERCE & INDUSTRIE PAYES DE LA LOIRE";"ES;IT;UK;DK;FR";
16949;V1022;REAL-TIME UTC;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Realization of a Real-Time Urban Traffic Control System;;;;"The aim of the project is to study, develop and test a traffic signal control system which is not based on a precalculated cycle masterplan as are most current systems, but on a real time system using dynamic programming which continuously adjusts green times in order to maximise the road network's throughput or other performance criteria.
Nowadays most current traffic light control systems are based on a precalculated cycle masterplan. They are not adaptive and therefore are unable to react to a variation of demand in traffic flow. Installed on an intersection to regulate the traffic, those systems are not optimal.
The aim of the project has been to study, develop and test a real time urban traffic control system. The main feature of this system has to be its capacity to always optimise traffic regulation by using the PRODYN algorithm.
The system will allow for several regulation levels. So it will permit optimisation of the traffic crossing an isolated intersection, optimisation of traffic for a set of intersections without a traffic control centre and optimisation of traffic for a set of intersections working under a traffic control centre.
To achieve the objectives of the project it is important to take into account field safety and traffic management constraints, analyse thoroughly current traffic controllers to discover their capabilities and limitations, carry out theoretical studies about alternative architectures and field problems, make PRODYN capable of operating all European types of traffic controller safely and efficiently and assess the operation of the system in real world tests.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The research into real time urban traffic control has included:
new development in the PRODYN road traffic control algorithm;
the development of a prototype interface, carefully designed to allow connection with every European traffic light controller;
recommendations for the integration of PRODYN into a road transport informatics (RTI) environment;
field experiments performed in Toulouse.

The results on one intersection and on an 8 intersections network show respectively 9% and 8% reduction in travel time.

In addition the research resulted in:
an improvement of the PRODYN algorithm;
the introduction of a controller stage which enables the algorithm to adapt to different pedestrian signal control philosophies;
a prototype system built around the improved algorithm.
Based on PRODYN algorithm, the system will allow for several regulation levels given a high degree of control to traffic authorities. These will include: 
- control of an intersection independently of all other intersections 
- control of several intersections as a group under the direction of a central unit 
- control of a set of interconnected intersections under the direction of a single unit. 
The system will be tested in the ZELT laboratory. 
Main Deliverables:

17269;P7081/CCAM;JANUS;;FP2-DELTA 1;;FP2;Joint Academic Network Using Satellite for European Distance Education and Training;;;;"This proposal is the first of a two-stage development. The ultimate aim is to establish in 1990 a private voice and date network satellite to link up European institutions wishing to work together to produce jointly distance teaching and training materials for delivery on a European-wide basis, and wishing to transfer credits between institutions. However, in order to do this, a number of technical, regulatory, educational and organisational issues have to be resolved. The aim of this proposals is to carry out the work that will enable the full project to be successfully implemented, in the form of a feasibility study. However, it should be noted that the feasibility study on its own will result in improved communications facilities between European educational industrial establishments. 

A feasibility study is suggested: 

i) to determine the cost and design specifications for an appropriate earth station for a voice and data network to link up European distance teaching institutions that can operate on the next generation of European satellites, ii) to develop appropriate software to improve the user-friendliness of terminals or work-stations for European-wide communications, and to facilitate the interface with satellite earth stations, iii) to develop improved operating procedures for computer conferencing, text transfer and editing at a distance, iv) to identify and if possible resolve the regulatory and cost issues resulting from the European-wide use of two-way voice and data via satellite for educational and training purposes. 

The ultimate aim is to develop and install relatively low-cost, narrow-band, two-way earth stations at each site (13 initially, in 10 countries in the second stage project), which will allow two-way voice communication between any two sites, audio conferencing across all sites for course team meetings and administrative meetings on credit transfer, electronic mail and computer conferencing facilities for transfer of draft teaching texts, minutes of meetings, etc., and an experimental video-conferencing facility at 64kbs. The network will be used to support the design and development of course materials for courses in four areas: European Law, European Business Studies, European Culture, and European Languages. These courses will be offered in all the 10 participating countries. 

In order thought for this project to be implemented successfully, it is necessary to develop a European- designed earth station capable of working with the new range of European satellites (OLYMPUS, Eutelsat II, Astra). The feasibility study aims to draw up a detailed design specification and to estimate accurately the likely costs of development of such an earth station. Secondly, currently operating procedures for electronic mail, computer conferencing, remote editing, and access to remote data-bases on wide area networks are not user friendly. Each of the institutions has varying levels of computer network and telephone exchange capability.

Secondly, current operating procedure for electronic mail, computer conferencing, remote editing, and access to remote data-bases on wide area networks are not user friendly.

The feasibility study aims to work towards common communications standards across the 13 main institutions, and to ensure that the earth station interface smoothly with the ground facilities at each site. Lastly, the currently regulatory framework inhibits such a proposed network on a commercial basis.

16945;V1028;TUNICS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Tunnel Integrated Control System;;;;"The general objectives of this project are to: 
- define recommendations concerning the use and the improvement of existing equipment used for the data acquisition subsystem. Propose additional equipment if required, 
- define recommendations concerning the use and the improvement of existing traffic control schemes. Propose additional traffic control models and schemes to ensure safe and high volume traffic, 
- review existing radio communication systems in underground environments and define recommendations for a standardized system taking into account the continuity of radio broadcast, the continuity of security service communications and their integration within an IRTE, 
- explore variable traffic message signs using electromagnetic, LCD & LED technologies and make recommendations as to their design (taking into account operational considerations such as impact on the driver, visibility, easy of use, flexibility and maintenance costs), 
- review existing systems with respect to access control, 
- recommend a standardized system architecture all of the above.
Traffic congestion and safety in road tunnels are frequent problems for the people in charge of a traffic network. The objectives will be to provide recommendations for a tunnel management system interfaced to an integrated road transport environment (IRTE). The approach will be practical and will make use of data and expertise related to several tunnels in different countries in Europe. The main objectives will be reached by covering the following aspects: existing traffic control schemes, radio communication systems in underground environments, traffic equipment, taking account of new technologies, the operation of ventilation systems, the operation of lighting systems, response to incidents and reduction in the number of tunnel operating personnel.
The TUNICS project has issued recommendations for an integrated tunnel management system including specific recommendations for traffic management, technical management, toll collection, telecontrol network, radio communications, traffic data acquisition, sensors and variable message signs.
A major emphasis of the program will be pilot projects, to demonstrate that the proposed recommendations will actually improve efficient safety in tunnels.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The aim of the research was to investigate the feasibility of integrating road tunnel management systems into the integrated road transport environment (IRTE). The importance of this interfacing and the potential benefits arising from it are discussed.

Tunnel functional subsystems were received and the following aspects of interfacing them with the IRTE were examined:
vehicle location systems;
dynamic route guidance;
fleet management;
driver information systems;
the radio data system traffic management channel;
motorway traffic flow control and monitoring;
incident and congestion detection;
road condition and weather monitoring;
road pricing.

Guidelines for a pilot project were provided.
The approach will be practical and will make use of data and expertise related to several tunnels in different countries in Europe.

18756;V1057;SECFO;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Systems Engineering and Consensus Formation Office;;;;"A team of experts of representing different sector actors and possessing different, complementary skills will follow the progress of the DRIVE projects with the objective of achieving consensus on Common Functional Specifications, Common Practices, consolidating the DRIVE submissions to standardization bodies and preparing implementation plans for RTI in Europe. They will also track RTI research in Europe outside DRIVE (EUREKA, COST and at the national level) and research outside Europe.
Clearly, the major obstacle for the implementation of road transport informatics (RTI) is the lack of standardised up to date traffic and travel information throughout Europe, which is the very prerequisite for effectively operating such systems. The baseline technologies and services available allow for the realisation of various road transport informatics systems for urban and interurban transport applications. A first attempt has been made to identify and appraise the main features of urban and interurban strategies.

For urban networks, road transport informatics was found to be particularly useful for implementing measures in the areas of traffic monitoring and control, traffic information and route guidance, public transport management and parking management. Strategies for medium or large cities need to be based upon some form of urban traffic control, which should be responsive to traffic demand and should incorporate automatic incident detection. Bus priority systems are crucial for increasing operational efficiency of public transport vehicles. In order to be effective, strategies for urban networks will require some form of demand management for producing the desired change in the choice of the transport mode.

For interurban motorway networks, road transport informatics was found to be particularly useful for implementing measures in the areas of traffic monitoring and control, traffic information and route guidance and fleet management. 2 key measures have been identified as being most effective in reducing congestion on motorways. There are physical network improvements, which in some cases will be the only measure to alleviate traffic problems, and the optimisation of trip patterns to avoid peak effects which cause the heaviest congestion. Road transport informatics systems providing easily accessible, reliable, up to date travel information are expected to be effective in reducing traffic peaks by spreading demand over time.
Because of its unique role SECFO has to be aware of the results and current thinking of all the DRIVE projects. For this reason SECFO members will engage actively in technical panel meetings and the Concertation Meetings. 
The method used by SECFO can be described as a Systems Approach i.e. making systems studies including both systems analysis and systems integration. SECFO will actively seek system ideas from each DRIVE project and study the integration and implementation consequences. 
Scenarios will serve as important tools in SECFO's work. They will be used to help conceptualize the future IRTE (the Integrated Road Transport Environment) for Europe. By using RTI systems scenarios, integration scenarios, usage and implementation scenarios SECFO plans to conceptually test different policy formulations and their impact on road traffic. These scenarios are seen as an important tool in the consensus formation process. 
The main tasks for SECFO are system integration, integration of standards, consensus formation, making of proposals and follow-up on Common Functional Specifications. SECFO's findings will be reported quarterly in a single document which will include sections on international trends, scenarios, standards, impacts, integration and implementation. The SECFO report will be updated quarterly and will, eventually, represent a complete long range IRTE Implementation Plan.

17063;A 1041 (9005);AIDMED;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Assistant for Interacting with multi media Medical Databases;;;;"1. To provide an easy to use, knowledge based interface to medical databases. 
2. To provide an easy way way to access and merge heterogeneous information sources such as: 
 - reports (text) 
 - images 
 - graphical presentations 
 - administrative data 
 - signal data 
 to multimedia documents. 
Within the scope of the exploratory phase an architecture for a system solving the above objectives will be defined.  
The intention of AIDMED (assistant for interacting with multimedia medical databases) was to address the need of medical personnel for easy access to the wide variety of information and data sources. As these are currently, or shortly, available in computerised form, part of the project was to provide an interface to enable this access, by exploiting currently available technology.

AIDMED involved the construction of a functional reference model for human computer interfaces on medical databases. Also included was the construction of prototype multimedia workstations using medical databases which can be used to investigate interface requirements in the real world medical environment.
The initial proposal is based on a model driven multi-layered architecture. The highes level - the presentation layer is driven by the user model. This model incorporates different user views of the information. 
The next lower level - the dialogue level is driven by the user model, naming scheme and the medical knowledge base. The knowledge incorporated in these models enables the system to converse with the user in his (medical) language. Also it enables the system to adapt its behaviour according to the user type incoporated in the user model. 
The next lower level - the access level in based upon the multimedia information model. This model provides a unified view onto the underlying heterogeneous medical databases (extant and future). 
The time framework for the project is 16 months. The estimated manpower is 127 months. The entire work is divided into 6 workpackages. The WP1 is devoted to the analysis of user needs with respect to the different types of information sources. It consumes a considerable amount of the allocated man-power - 32 MM. In WP2 the existing facilities in hospitals will be examined. WP3 is devoted to the system definition and to the design of the knowledge-based access model and of the multi-media data model. In WP4 some selected aspects of the defined system will be implemented as a prototype. WP5 is devoted to the evaluation and appraisal of the proposed solution. Finaly the WP6 is devoted to the project management.

Building on work which has already been done by one of the participants, in the field of planning, organizing and delivering community care, in partnership with general practitioners and social services agencies, the project will take as its starting point an existing outline specification for an MBDS and produce a preliminary MBDS which will then be subjected to international review.
The CHIC project has produced 2 ambulatory care data set specifications:
an ambulatory encounter based minimum basic data set (MBDS),
a health career based patient related data set (PRDS),
transmission of clinical information about patients when they move or travel;
effectiveness and efficiency of research in ambulatory care, by allowing the establishment of large European data banks of anonymous epidemiological data;
comparison of cost price data, permitting an analysis of impact of financing systems on the cost of care.

The members of the project consortium are making presentations to CEN, EWOS and EFMI through their national representatives in order that the CHIC MBDS/PRDS be adopted as standards. Additionally developments are taking place to seek national accreditation of the finalized data sets in participating countries.
The MBDS will be validated through a postal survey supported by presentations to selected groups of practitioners. Coverage will be strongest in the countries of the partners but some coverage of all Community countries will be attempted. 
In the time available, it is not possible to develop software to support the use of the MBDS but specifications of the requirements which such software must meet will be produced. 
The project will coordinate with AIM project 8513.

18758;V1046;FRIDA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Framework for Integrated Dynamic Analysis of Travel and Traffic;;;;"The project's objective is to create an integrated model structure appropriate for RTI Policy analysis and then to use this model structure in order to produce evaluation criteria for RTI system effects.
FRIDA's main objective was to provide a modelling framework for an integrated dynamic analysis of travel and traffic. This framework essentially aims at describing and specifying the modelling of the subsystems of the driving task (individual and collective), and most importantly to establish their integration.

The research dealt with the following objectives:
the specification of an integrated modelling framework, as well as the definition of a set of performance criteria for evaluation resulting from models within the framework;
the investigation of a travel behaviour subsystem focused on the dynamics of pretrip time choices, which are most likely to be affected by the introduction of the road transport informatics (RTI) systems;
the investigation of an individual on the road (driver) behaviour subsystem, concentrating on crucial aspects, such as adherence to a controlled traffic environment;
the investigation of traffic analysis and management subsystems referring mainly to issues that improve the predictive ability of traffic management models, following their adaption to the integrated road transport environment (IRTE) requirements.
The project considers that the application of RTI demands for its analysis a modelling framework capable of integrating 3 sub-models - travel behaviour, driver behaviour and traffic modelling - into a coherent whole. 
The project will define all the elements of that framework and will suggest a structure for organizing these elements into an all-embracing model system. 
The proposed technical approach is based on defining model forms appropriate to capture the essential features of RTI-based policies by adequately adapting existing operational models, adapting theoretical models and, eventually, proposing new models if required. 
Using input from other Projects in task areas T203 and T301, specifications will be defined for the above models. 
The proposed modelling framework will also produce a set of evaluation criteria to be used as an input to projects in task areas 206 and 207. 
In return, initial findings from projects in task areas 206 and 207 will give feed back to FRIDA and will be combined with a more in-depth investigation in the next phase of the project. 
The results of the final phase of the project will be the finalisation of the modelling framework, as well as the formulation of a final set of classified evaluation criteria, along with suggestions on their use for evaluation of RTI effects.

To generate the Multimedial Medical Diagnostic Assistant (MEDICA) as a core tool for intelligent multi-medial diagnostic support. 
Objectives 
To specify methods and standards for producing and interpreting digitized material that supports intelligent medical diagnostic support. 
To deliver an experimentally tried command and control language to drive : 
a) medical image data-bases ; 
b) communication with other components of hospital Information Systems. 
To specify an appropriate hardware and software environment : 
a) to display and interact with the stored data; 
b) delivered on a microcomputer with a 'windows' environment; 
c) making use of current developments in hypertext presentation and knowledge representation radically to enhance the user interface. 
To specify functional standards for flexibility and transparency in the presentation and design of the user interface. 
To deliver a first version prototype (mock-up and interface design). 
MEDICA produced functional specifications and a prototype for a multimedia medical diagnostic assistant in the field of psychiatry. Its potential effectiveness is currently being investigated (one clinician already estimated that the system might increase the time available to him for direct patient care by at least 50%).

Preliminary investigations of the market potential of the MEDICA System have been undertaken among groups of psychiatric practitioners in various member states. The results indicate that there could be a substantial demand. In addition to this, it is clear that the techniques of knowledge elicitation and systems specification developed and refined during the first stage of the project are themselves marketable, and that there is likely to be an 'added value' market for consultancy and training in this field.

Such tools and facilities must be usable on a Community-wide basis, and applicable to a wide range of applications. This project develops the concept of an Integrated Health Information and Decision Support Workbench (Health Bench), which will provide a framework for tools designed to assist the implementation and operation of health computing applications.

The future system will be able to support the definition and prototyping of Health Information System components, including databases, and general purpose software modules (applications) for decision support, independently of each particular health sub-domain in which it will be used. Some of these modules will consist of simple storage/query/reporting applications, but others will be more sophisticated (expert) systems to aid, for example, in making diagnostic and other decision tasks. The workbench will also be able to generate default versions of the most useful forms of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) including linguistic ones (for each specific sub-domain). 
The project is aimed at defining the basic requirements, at modelling the most general objects in the medical universe that will be used in the context of the various specific sub-domains, at defining a general architecture of the workbench and finally at implementing specific software prototypes in order to test the feasibility of the envisaged system 
By the end of this project a clear definition and feasibility study for an Integrated Health Information and Decision Support Workbench will be completed and some of its implementation aspects will be tested by means of the construction of their software prototypes. Hence, a final effort could then be started for the actual construction of the envisaged system. 
Already existing methods (like object orientation) will be used to define all static and dynamic aspects of the envisaged contexts and existing software tools (like Database Management Systems, Applications Generators and Expert System Shells) will be used to implement the specific software prototypes. 
Work will be done in the areas of Medical Knowledge Representation, Databases, Linguistic Human/Machine Interfaces (Generation of Dedicated Medical Language Tools) and Reasoning from Medical Databases.

18757;V1052;ICARUS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Interurban Control and Road Utilization Simulation;;;;"The basic aim of this project is to identify the effect of RTI measures on the existing relationships between speed flow and capacity on interurban roads. 
Conversely, the effects of traffic flow and behavioural conditions on the performance of RTI systems will be considered.
Work has been concerned with the development and use of a series of calibrated microscopic simulation models to investigate the potential range of road transport informatics (RTI) measures to provide improvements in efficiency, safety and economy on interurban highways.
The 3 main devices investigated in the simulation models have been:
headway advice and control systems, acting on vehicle to vehicle following relationships (the headway element governs the longitudinal distance or time spacing between vehicles, by giving advice on following distances);
speed advice and control systems;
lane changing aids on multilaned roads and overtaking aids on 2-lane, 2-way roads (these attempt to influence the lateral movements of vehicles and seek to aid both safety and capacity by achieving a more optimal flow and desired speed).
After a review of empirical studies and existing microscopic simulation models, as well as of RTI technologies, the most appropriate modelling techniques will be determined for the project. 
It is anticipated to use two simulation models out of 3 available currently by partners of the consortium, and modify and develop them appropriately in order to fulfil the basic aims of the project, i.e. to represent traffic-flow-capacity relationships on a wide range of interurban road conditions (from 2- lane single carriageway roads to multi-lane motorways) and assess the effects of the introduction of RTI facilities on them. 
The 2 models will be validated - calibrated on field data representing a wide range of European conditions, by taking measurements in 4 countries, i.e. Germany, U.K., Greece and Norway and using various modern data collecting techniques (e.g. video techniques, aerial observations, etc...) 
Where, there is a new need emerging, new model elements will be developed accordingly. 
If measurements of traffic flow and associated parameters are available from other Projects these data will be used to validate the RTI elements within the simulation models. 
Subsequently the 2 models, after their calibration, will be used to run an extensive series of simulation runs covering various road, traffic and environmental conditions. 
These runs will be repeated with and without superimposition of the RTI technology, so that the effects of RTI systems on speed-flow-capacity relationships will be determined under various conditions. 
The driver's behavioural response to RTI aids will be assessed through a series of additional sensitivity tests. 
The results on all the above simulation runs under various conditions will be analysed statistically in order to draw conclusions in a systematic way of the effect of RTI systems' introduction on fundamental traffic relationships. 
Finally, an attempt will be made to analyse and evaluate the implications of RTI systems at the inter-urban/urban interface, and to explore the links which should connect inter-urban and urban RTI systems.

17268;P7074/D1006;ESSENTIAL;;FP2-DELTA 1;;FP2;European Systems Strategy for the Evolution of New Technology in Advanced Learning;;;;"This project brings to DELTA a major grouping of industrial and commercial concerns, large and small, together with academic and research institutes. All are united by a common objective: the development of a European consensus on the systems and technology infrastructure to support and enable the development and expansion of a dynamic European industry sector concerned with the exploitation in information technology for training. 
19 workshops have been held on the subject of user requirements for an open learning system, and functional specifications of advanced learning technology tools have been defined. A hypertext based learning system life cycle model has been developed to describe the whole life cycle of courseware, from the initial planning and production to the final use, in terms of user requirements.
The proposal addresses the two critical factors upon which the success this enterprise depends. The first of these is the provision of a technical framework and method which supports the consensus process and welds together the disparate technical interests represented in the consortium and the diverse areas of activity in the programme. The second is the creation of an appropriate management and technical coordination and communications structure which will ensure efficient progress toward our goals. 

Our technical approach takes three viewpoints in its investigation of the systems and technologies for training: the efficient development of courseware, its effective delivery and the systems components needed to support both of these endeavors. 

We have three strands of activity which will coordinate these activities and ensure that they provide coherent input into the DELTA consensus process. These are: Requirements modelling, which will define common methods for expressing, comparing and evaluating the requirements on tools, systems and infrastructure created by each of the investigative strands; Technology Scenarios, which provide common means for exploring techno-economic and technology options and evolutions with the many different actors who have an interest in the European Training Enterprise; Functional specifications, which represent the initial embodiment of a reference model for the Portable Educational Tools Environment. 

By carefully managing the interactions between these two groups of activities, we will ensure that not only the detailed investigative and evaluation work in undertaken and reported in the different task areas of AL II but that a coherent and cogent strategy for the systems infrastructure for training in Europe is also created.";;;;;MARI Advanced Microelectronics Ltd;UK;"Intrasoft;Loughborough University of Technology;YARD LTD;Agusta SpA;UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;Centre d'Etudes Superieures Industrielles (CESI);UNIV.

This will be achieved by: 

1. Examination of the reciprocal influence of markeys and standards. 

2. Study and specification of systems architecture which will reduce the cost of distributing training courseware, facilitate training services management and enhance tutor/learner interaction. 
studies on the market integration of multimedia online services have included:
analysis of the reciprocal influences of markets and standards from economic, psychological, sociological, organizational and technical perspectives;
a large scale market analysis of expressed and latent user demands, and current and emerging supply side strategies (including analysis of supply demand interactions);
market testing of draft standards (technological and nontechnological) with lead users across Europe.
OSIRIS will deliver positive statements and recommendations on the following issues at the end of DELTA's exploratory phase: 

- the willingness of organisations indifferent parts on Europe to invest in ALT at the same rate and to the same scale (the standardisation of the market) 
- current practices and prospects for integrated standardisation (interoperability) at the European level in technical infrastructure, ALT environments, learner and tutor competences and organisational adaptability 
- the prospects for standardisation and interoperability of ALT design tools to enable flexible interface construction to accommodate varied training environments and needs 
- comparative developments in the above areas by Europe's main competitors 
- critical definition of, and proposed standards for, Open Learning over the two year period 
- the best combinations of academic specialisations to design ALT solutions 
- the co-ordination of organisations in the goods and services sector involved in the design, production and exploitation of training systems based on advanced network 
- the design of integrated learning systems with advanced components.

17039;A1009 (8513);MCACE;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Measurement, Characterization and Control of Ambulatory Care in Europe;;;;"This project aims to lay the groundwork for the development of harmonized mechanisms, methods and standards for the measurement, characterization and control of ambulatory care provision in the Europe of the 1990's, essential for the general improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care. 
Specifically, McACE's objective is to provide a set of concepts and models as a framework for developing a common understanding of the problems and possibilities, to initiate and support the necessary longer-term consensus building process. 
The provision of this framework aims to clarify the options for the definition of an European Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) for ambulatory care, and propose a suitable model for such a MBDS. Furthermore, the project aim to characterize the dimensions of resource use and resource management in European ambulatory care, and clarify the role and relevance of Ambulatory Visit Group (AVG) methodology and MBDS in this context. To enable the efficient collection of valid and usable data and in support of ambulatory care planning, management and control, the project aims to identify the likely characteristics of the necessary IT systems and standards infrastructure. 
Research has been carried out into the design of minimum (basic) data sets (MBDS) for ambulatory care in Europe. A set of concepts and models were produced as a framework for developing a common understanding of the problems and possibilities, to initiate and support the necessary longer term consensus building process. The hospital based concept of MBDS was reviewed and altered in planning and implementing MDSs by algorithm. An understanding of requirements and constraints for MDS was obtained, with specific attention to resource use MDS. For this purpose the concept of the ambulatory care unit (ACU) was explored. Also the ambulatory visit group (AVG) methodology, for case mix measures in ambulatory care, was considered for the European situation. An analytical accounting model, linking ambulatory care events to resource use, had to be developed for describing systems for resource use management and accounting. The development of the AVG methodology was a prime focal point for this investigation. From the point of view information technology and infrastructure the understanding of ambulatory care itself is an absolute prerequisite. The project focused on the environment in which the relevant information is captured, transmitted, managed and eventually exploited. At the data collection interface there are various human factor related issues (eg motivation, usability, nonintrusiveness, and confidence) which have an impact on questions of feasibility, validity and quality of data. The issues which typically have an impact on the utility of any data collected are those concerned with standards for representation, storage and interchange. An evaluation of the work performed was an integral part of the project. It showed that the AVG is not directly applicable in Europe.
Through a final project phase of analysis of results ofprior previous phases, McACE will develop plans and recommendations for future Community-wide actions necessary to achieve a harmonized approach, particularly in relation to the development, evaluation, and acceptance of relevant standards both in the medical and IT fields, and the experimentation, validation and dissemination of the appropriate models and methods.

16970;V1003;VAMOS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Requirements and System Specification for Dynamic Traffic Messages;;;;"The main objective of this project is to define a methodical and systematic approach to the problem of the distribution of information to drivers through roadside infrastructures both in urban and extra-urban environment.
The survey carried out on European variable message sign (VMS) systems currently in use provided a rich source of information and permitted the real state of the art to be assessed. Analysis of this survey identified the following key aspects of VMS application: system objectives, strategies adopted, message presentation and content, display technologies, detection and information collection, data handling and processing and system assessments.
An analysis was made of road operators' objectives for using VMS and the definition of measures of effectiveness (MOE) used in assessing them. The major conclusions of this exercise were that the few systems that had been subjected to a quantitative analysis, were found to be successful but to varying degrees, and that VMS system development in general could benefit from homogenous and systematic operational and socioeconomic analyses of the effectiveness and impacts of advanced VMS systems. By means of the survey and its consequent analysis, the project was able to identify the exemplary features of some of the most successful systems currently in use. The final recommendations of the project were based partly on the observance of current successful practices and partly on the modelling and simulation work performed during the research and development stage of the project.
The following 5 application fields were identified to provide a framework for the analysis of the objectives and information requirements for VMS systems: motorway section, motorway interaction with other roads, motorway network, urban route choice and rural signalling and warning. These 5 application fields conveniently cover not only the different types of roads or environments (motorways, other extraurban and rural roads, urban roads), but also the basic elements of a network (intersection or node, section or link, network). Hence any suitable scenario for VMS application could be classified under one of these fields. The application field framework w as also used during the development and recommendation phases of the work. Simulation models were identified and developed for these fields, and specific architectural, operational and ergonomic recommendations were made on the basis of the results achieved and of the analysis of current practice.

Studies of existing variable message sign (VMS) systems show a clear trend towards systems that are less dedicated to a particular objective or strategy. More versatile displays are now being used that are able to show a wider variety of message and that sometimes incorporate more than one type of technology on the same sign. It is therefore possible to identify a process of functional and technological integration within the VMS application domain. For the superdomain of the entire road transport environment, a similar process of integration has been identified. In this superdomain, VMS constitutes one of many road transport informatics (RTI) technologies that may be effectively combined to achieve major improvements in road safety, traffic efficiency and environmental control.
The project investigated the potential for further integration both within the VMS domain and within the larger domain of the integrated road transport environment (IRTE). Practical innovative recommendations were made for combining traffic control functions on a single sign and for combining VMS with advanced in vehicle technologies.
Considerable effort was devoted to developing system concepts and architectures for VMS systems that would integrate functions or applications (eg weather related warnings, road closures, diversions, lane allocation) and that would remain open to include the operation of other technologies. Attention was focused on the extraurban application fields.
A general requirements analysis was made for the extraurban application fields in order to identify specific problems encountered, to assess the effectiveness of currently available variable message sign (VMS) measures, to determine what and how much information is needed to enable an efficient application of VMS measures and to determine the technical requirements for system architectures, roadside data acquisition and processing and message display elements. Extraurban control strategies were surveyed and the m ost significant influencing factors and boundary conditions were identified. In the case of motorway network control in particular, appropriate estimation and prediction methods for improving the control strategies of route guidance systems were pointed out. Diversion strategies were tested on a simulation of a motorway/secondary road network situated to the north of Munich. The main 3-lane motorway route through this network is often congested and vehicles are required to divert onto another 2-lane motorway or onto a 1-lane secondary trunk road. The simulated network was constructed specifically for the purposes of the project. Traffic simulation was carried out by the macroscopic model SIMONE.
Aspects of driver behaviour affecting the operational effectiveness of VMS constitutes an important open research area. A behavioural model was developed to assess driver response to speed limitations imposed by VMS. The model was based on experiments made on a stretch of motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany and was incorporated in the SPEACS simulator. Driver behaviour was observed for simulation of a vehicle population of 1000.
A prototype was made available on 25/08/92

System concepts and architectures were developed for specific applications according to the envisaged needs of the user. The information, processing and general technical requirements for implementing the recommended system architectures and concepts were analysed and reported for 5 application fields. Specifically for the extraurban application fields, architectures and concepts were developed for 3 scenarios: high capacity motorways surrounded by low capacity secondary roads, motorway route guidance and rural signalling and warning.
In the first scenario special considerations regarding data sources, control elements and variable message sign (VMS) control strategies were made and the requirements for implementing the following measures were examined: traffic diversion, recommendation of an alternative route, warnings on motorways of unfavourable or dangerous conditions and traffic diversion from secondary roads to the motorway.
For the second scenario the characteristics of subsystems constituting a motorway route guidance system were examined and presented. The following subsystems were identified: data acquisition subsystem, data processing subsystem, display subsystem, data transmission subsystems and energy supply subsystem.
The following types of VMS system and typical measures were identified for the third scenario: section control systems (speed control, overtaking prohibitions, traffic and weather related warnings), warning systems (eg fog, black ice at particularly dangerous spots), speed control systems at critical points (eg town entrances, narrow bends), diversion systems (eg closing of steep gradient sections in the event of snow or ice) and parking information systems (eg at tourist sites). A systematic analysis ofrequirements for a modular, hierarchical VMS system architecture was made. This entailed an outline of the essential system levels, the identification of input data requirements and of the required system components for data acquisition and transmission and for power supply. General functional requirements and operational constraints were set. The general requirements analysis produced during this phase would provide a useful basis from which specifications can be derived for the design of any foreseeable VMS system for use in the extraurban environment.
A set of general recommendations for appropriate technologies for implementing the proposed strategies and architectures has been prepared. Recommendations were made according to the application field. A set of principles were also proposed for coping with general operating problems such as hardware maintenance, fault and error tolerance. Recommendations were made for effective VMS location, for the use and composition of text messages, appropriate pictograms and sign features.
The issue of integrating VMS within the new integrated road transport environment (IRTE). Scenarios were suggested that would feature the integration of VMS with in vehicle technologies.
The project's recommendations have been summarised in the WHITE BOOK for VMS applications. This document has now been distributed to about 200 road operators, manufacturers and other experts involved in the design, installation and operation of VMS systems.
A strategy for displaying information in the context of the future general IRTE will be developed. At present it is envisaged that roadside infrastructures for displaying information will still be used but will become increasingly `intelligent'. The `intelligent' road signs will display credible information and warnings which will be regularly updated on the basis of information from other RTI systems like traffic flow data from a route guidance service.  
The scope of the project includes on-board driver information equipment and research will define what information needs to be provided by these. Since the project deals with dynamic traffic messages it may also investigate and assess to what extent different ways of providing information influence behaviour and traffic control strategies. 
To date standardization activity in this field has been devoted to producing standards for signs and pictograms. At present no European standard exists for Variable Message Signs (VMS). Another objective of the project is therefore to begin standardization work by specifying the requirements for information exchange between roadside VMS and drivers. In particular a minimum level of and degree of relevance of information has to be defined. 
The project is closely aligned to the objectives of the 'Extra-urban Signalling and Communication Systems' task. The goal is the study and the definition of control and information systems for private and public traffic on inter-urban roads and in rural areas.

16952;V1025;EURONETT;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Evaluating User Responses on New European Transport Technologies;;;;"The main objectives of EURONETT are: (i) to evaluate how travellers will change their short term behaviour in response to the range of possible RTI scenarios; (ii) to assess the long term impacts of RTI strategies on land use, on activity patterns and on the European transport industry.
A commercial computer game was selected, which depicts in 3 dimensional graphics the driver's view of a street scene and various controls. It allows the user to manoeuvre a vehicle around the street network using a joystick, while being provided with different types in vehicle information. Information was provided in 4 ways:
a base with a street map;
an electronic map showing the current position by a flashing light in real time;
external advice by audio messages at intersections;
a radio data system (RDS) giving messages related to current congestion patterns.

The external message system seemed effective in enabling respondents to avoid congestion. Subjects did not make much use of the RDS system. Subjects themselves rated the conventional map as most useful and the electronic map at least useful.

In a validation exercise a small sample of drivers were set similar real world navigation tasks, using an instrumented vehicle with selected road transport informatics (RTI) equipment. The 2 experiment gave substantially consistent results, which were used to calibrate a simple route choice model in which varying proportions of vehicles are equipped with RTI technologies.

The research was based on surveys on responses to road pricing in Trondheim and Athens. In Trondheim in Norway there is a plan to introduce an electronic road pricing system with automatic debiting. A total of 450 survey exercises were sent out. In the sample as a whole 22% were prepared to pay the toll at levels specified without changing their behaviour, but in most cases, the higher the toll the greater the incidence of travel time changes. A high proportion of the sample had a public transport alternative, but with longer travel times. 12% reported that they would shift to public transport at all levels of toll.

Currently cars are allowed in a restricted area of central Athens on alternate days, depending on whether they have an odd or even numbered license plate. Two alternative road pricing scenarios are to replace the number plate restriction by pricing within the same cordon, and to allow exceptions to the restriction in return for a payment on certain specific corridors on which there is available capacity. Stated preference interviews were carried out with 130 users. It appears that the precise setting of the toll level will have a substantial effect on public acceptability, and that it should be set with reference to the level of time savings achieved from the reductions in congestion. Credit card was the preferred method of payment, followed by prepaid debit card and prepaid monthly card.

An experimental parking information service in Nottingham provides drivers with up to the minute information by local radio station on the occupancy and queues at car parks in the city, including park and ride sites. On street interviews and self completion mailback questionnaires were analysed.

The main impacts of the service on travel behaviour were found to be through changing the choice of parking location or type within the city centre, encouraging the use of park and ride, and changing the time of day of travel. Most travellers choose where they are going to park at the pretrip stage.

The research was based on surveys on responses to in trip public transport information in Coventry and Athens. The country research assessed the effects of interactive machines to provide in trip information such as timetables, journey times, route numbers and bus stop locations at Coventry Railway Station. A total of 329 interviews were carried out. The information most required was bus times, numbers and routes, rail times, location of stops, and frequencies. Few users viewed more than six or seven screens. A majority of users found it easy to use, and would do so again, although over a quarter found it difficult, and more in middle aged and older age groups. The aspect which seemed to cause most difficulty was understanding the machine itself, rather than the information given.

The Athens research was based on a home and office written questionnaire administered to 400 respondents concerning the effects of information on mode use, presented in a hypothetical manner. The context was one in which the congestion and parking difficulties made driving very unattractive, and therefore increased the use of public transport. Analysis indicated that information alone is unlikely to increase use, unless accompanied by measures to increase reliability.

The research was based on enhanced traffic control measures in Birmingham. The attitudes and perceptions of different groups of motorists to specific control measures, namely the SCOOTtraffic control network, a tidal flow system, and ramp metering at Motorway junctions were examined. A total of 203 interviews were carried out. Awareness of the traffic control measures was found to be low. Even after prompting, a majority of respondents were unaware of some of the measures including ramp meters and SCOOT. The measures thought most effective were tidal flow, red light cameras, and variable message signs. Most respondents thought that their plans and driving behaviour would not be affected by traffic control measures, but of those saying that their plans would be affected, about equal numbers said they would avoid, or actively seek out, routes where there were traffic control measures. 60% of all drivers said that the measures with which they were already familiar had led them to drive more slowly.

The research was based on surveys of responses to pretrip information in Athens and Birmingham. Information was provided both in and outside the home. With regard to home based information, respondents in Athens showed more interest in information about public transport alternatives, whereas in Birmingham there was more interest in enquiries involving journey retiming. In both sites there was a preference for only acquiring information about a limited number of alternatives, typically 2 to 5. The quantity and type of pretrip information requested by travellers depended on a range of personal, journey related, contextual and national factors. This implies that pan-European pretrip information technologies must be sufficiently flexible in their design to allow a range of different modes of enquiry corresponding to travellers' particular requirements and to differences in national conditions.

In the use of out of home information both mode and destination were fixed, but route and departure time were allowed to vary. Options were shown to respondents on a computer screen, giving departure time, travel time, parking cost and route. They then ranked the options in order of preference. Respondents in Birmingham again had more flexibility in retiming than those in Athens. The Athens sample were most easily able to shift departure to later than to earlier. It was found that travellers would change their behaviour under the influence of information to avoid traffic congestion.

The research was aimed at assessing the likely effects of enhanced information systems on travel behaviour (route choice, mode choice, time of day of travel, and other responses) and on the transport industry and the long term development of cities.

Theoretical work has included a substantial literature review, and specific studies of road transport informatics (RTI) scenarios, urban typology, the impact on public transport and freight industries, and an evolutionary approach to long term technical innovation. A series of qualitative surveys were undertaken, using small sample sizes and in-depth interviewing methods to develop and understanding of factors affecting driver attitudes to information so that the main quantitative surveys would be appropriately specified.

The research suggested 5 general conclusions:
where good and easy to use information is offered there is a willingness to use it and this can affect behaviour;
the effects of RTI on travel behaviour will be more profound in policy applications addressing public transport, traffic restraint and road pricing than in route guidance and traffic management;
travellers live with a high degree of ignorance or faulty knowledge and they often prefer to obtain their knowledge from traditional sources;
implementation of new RTI systems has to be carried out with close consideration of the actual circumstances of the location;
information sensitive demand analysis techniques need to be based on a recognition that imperfect information exists and that the process whereby knowledge is acquired and assessed is of importance in understanding how behaviour changes.

The research was based on an experiment undertaken to assess drivers' responses to in vehicle information systems. The experiment utilised a personal computer (PC) simulation and gaming approach to assess user responses to a number of in vehicle driver information system concepts. It concentrated primarily on the effects on route choice, and investigated driver responses to advice and guidance from onboard navigation aids, dynamic route guidance systems and the radio data system traffic message channel (RDS TMC).

It was found that RDS TMC and dynamic route guidance produced significant changes in driver responses (in terms of route choice) from users across a variety of measures. Significant improvements in route quality were obtained through using the dynamic route guidance system, whereas RDS TMC helped to reduce the amount of congestion encountered by subjects en route.
Drivers had a strong preference for the conventional map compared with the onboard navigation aid.
The experimental design used was shown to be suitable for carrying out the planned analysis and various measures of experimental design performance indicated a good degree of design. The experimental approach adopted proved popular with subjects and provided an effective way of exposing the public to road transport informatics (RTI) concepts in prototype form.

The basic aim of the research was to identify the effects of possible road transport informatics (RTI) measures on existing relationships between traffic flow and capacity on interurban roads with particular reference to multilane motorway traffic. The characteristics of traffic flow and the behavioural aspects of the performance of RTI systems were considered. This required a detailed microscopic description of the interactions between a driver and his vehicle and the interactions between different driver vehicle units under certain road and traffic flow conditions.

The computer model developed provided an analysis of traffic flow on a multilane motorway under the following conditions:
driver interactions without any RTI implementations;
driving totally controlled by RTI; RTI supported driving.
The consortium has taken an experimental approach to analyse travel behaviour in the context of activity patterns. 
In order to assess short term reactions, a series of likely RTI scenarios will be produced and case studies will be set up to test them. The transnational experiments will be conducted on a sample of different groups of travellers and they will comprise the following activities: 
(i) Preliminary qualitative explorations. 
(ii) Experimental survey (stated preference method) 
(iii) Further data collection. 
(iv) Guidelines for development of predictive methods. 
The long term impacts of RTI will be assessed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods such as traditional land use models, Delphi interview panels and econometric demand models. The final product of EURONETT is a set of models and research methods. The EURONETT suite of sub-models will cover activity patterns, travel choice models and psychological models to predict short term changes in journey timing and routing. The calibration of the models will be done using data collected in two contrasting countries as well as from the results of other work. 
The EURONETT suite will also include a model to be used as the `umbrella model' (which will not produce precise figures) sitting on top of traditional forecasting models. This will be based on the evolutionary theory of the diffusion of new technologies but applied specifically to the transport sector in the light of RTI. The modelling methodology is based on the interrelationships between societal development and existing transport systems.

Evaluation of the impact of image pre-processing and analysis on clinical diagnosis. 
Definition of standards for the processing of echographic data, processing and image display formats. 
Hardware and algorithms for processing and analysing echographic signals and images have been specified and tested for practical applied use.

The definition of the hardware and software for the data acquisition and processing of radio frequency echographic signals can be considered as a first version of a standard for the interface between the diagnostic ultrasound equipment and its storage and processing parts.

It can be expected that the next generation of equipment for medical echographic diagnosis will be based on digital signal processing, as specified in this project. (Echographic equipment represents more than 20% of the whole European market of medical imaging equipment).
The project will be carried out in three stages : 
1. Pre-competitive phase 
The first year will be devoted to the functional specification and the implementation of the hardware for data-acquisition of radio-frequency echo-signals and (pre)processing of these data, for image formation and image processing. Also the software for acquisition and pre-processing will be specified and implemented. 
2. Pre-normative phase 
The following two years will be necessary to perform two parallel studies. The first is concerned with the assessment of the analysis of echo data in a clinical (retrospective) study by making use of the created hard- and software environment of phase 1. This approach will enable the necessary pooling of clinical data. In the second study, the processing of echographic images will be evaluated by psychophysical studies. Implications for the hard- and software derived from these studies will be implemented. 
3. Normative phase 
European standards will be developed by making use of the results of the preceeding steps for the processing of echographic data, which produce homegeneous and generalizable output data, and for the display format(s) of echographic images. This action will be performed during the final year of the project.

16960;V1013;CERACS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Comparative Evaluation of the Different Radiating Cables and Systems Technologies;;;;"The objective of this project is to determine the suitability of different cable systems for communications in difficult environments particularly in urban areas.
The objective of the project was to determine the suitability of leaky feeders systems for road to vehicles communications in difficult environments particularly in urban areas.
A survey of the state of the art including a review of existing systems and research and development regarding the application of leaky feeders to road traffic systems and in other environments with similar characteristics for example mines and underground railways has been performed.
A requirement analysis presents the main functional specifications of leaky feeders for road vehicles communications focusing on other applications than tunnel communications and including economical data.
The systems and interfaces work studies the electronic environment of the leaky feeders including number of channels, repeaters, coverage, etc. Economical data are also provided. This extensive analysis covers European, Japanese and American leaky feeders systems.
As current radiating systems use carriers ranging from a few kHz to 1.7 GHz and slotted waveguide systems are working at much higher frequencies, it is necessary to consider European standards for bandwidth, modulation technique, harmonic suppression and radiated power.
Leaky feeders systems are very long antennas and are good interference collectors when laid close to power lines, overhead lines, etc. Cars and onboard computers are also good perturbations generators but are vulnerable to electromagnetic perturbations. So the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is considered to be important into a road transport informatics (RTI) environment. European standards dealing with EMC and cars are studied. Then theoretical and experimental studies are presented to develop a performance prediction method. This activity has developed theoretical tools to characterise leaky feeders in terms of electromagnetic performances. The basic mechanism of the various types of leaky feeders are thoroughly theoretically studied. Using examples, some experimental res ults emphasising the main features of a radiating cable are compared to the results already outlined in the theoretical part. An important work is devoted to a comparison between measured values of coupling losses and the ones predicted by the theoretical model. As a conclusion, some comments are presented on the help that such a modelisation can bring to the conception of planned infrastructures using a leaky cable system.

Radio data systems (RDS) on frequency modulation (FM) channels for road transport informatics (RTI) purposes will be widely used in the next few years. As these data transmissions are at a relatively low rate, good quality transmission must be achieved. Starting from this condition and from the fact that RDS tunnel communications have to be maintained, we have studied the performance of RDS transmissions using leaky feeders.

We have made error rate measurements of RDS FM radio retransmissions using leaky feeders. As the radiation modes in tunnels are quite different from open areas and are also dependent on the tunnel shape and on the leaky feeder used, these performances have been measured on several test sites in France and in Belgium.

The results show that good retransmission of signals is possible in shadow areas. Some difficulties occur at both ends of the link where there are beating phenomena between the conventional radio signal and the leaky cable one. A comparison of microwave (10 GHz) and leaky cable (100 MHz) signals was also made. Although these 2 technologies are difficult to compare, the results show that much lower masking effects are noticed using leaky cables than microwave beacons. This could be important for specific applications such as automatic tolling. A new application of leaky cables is described. This is the RDS beacon which makes it possible to transmit locally a specific RDS TMC traffic management control message without new equipment in the car. This system uses the same frequency as a conventional broadcast to transmit information into a small cell specific RDS or RDS TMC using a short length of leaky feeder laid along the road.

In considering electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems we found that the disturbance voltage at the leaky cable terminals induced by ignition systems or the local oscillator was negligible although the disturbance voltage at the car receiver input induced by the ignition system was not negligible. Additionally, we found that the local oscillator perturbation at the car receiver was not negligible but could be avoided by correct frequency allocation.

Leaky cables provide an effective solution to the problem of radiopropagation where receivers are momentarily in a radiomagnetic shadow area (eg, in tunnels, in urban environments or in hilly countries). This research investigated the properties of some specific system architectures which can solve most of the problems encountered. These analyses are based on experimental findings in a number of European countries.

Technically, our studies have shown that suitable telecommunication systems can be divided into 2 groups. One using direct amplification of the signals and the other using a carrier frequency to transmit the audio signals between various transceivers. Direct amplification should be used when the leaky cable area is not isolated enough from that of other transmitters using the same frequency. A carrier system, thanks to the low attenuation of the carrier frequency is highly flexible, as different parts of the system (transmitters, receivers, control circuits, antennae etc) can be isolated.

In general, a radiating cable ensures the continuity of radio links in areas where radio signals do not freely propagate produces a spatially limited axial radiation which avoids interference in other areas. We have also shown that with an adequate system architecture, communication can be maintained even when there is a cable break. The theoretical models developed help in the choice of cable type and in evaluating the architecture of the system. The models proposed, when applied to radiated mode and coupled mode cables, lead to coupling loss values in agreement with those measured on site.
This project is divided into eight workpackages: 
1. A survey of the a state of the art, including a review of all existing systems and R&D regarding the application of cables to road traffic systems and in other environments with similar characteristics for example mines and underground railways. As a result of this workpackage the rest of the project will focus on the 2 or 3 most important systems. 
2. A requirements analysis with the objective of defining the main functional specifications of cable systems (such as the type of messages to be carried, interfaces to other systems etc.) 
3. This workpackage `Systems and Interfaces' will study the electronic environment of the cables including number of channels, repeaters, coverage and transitions between radio systems and cable systems. 
4. Studies frequency allocation. As current radiating systems use carriers ranging from a few kHz to 2.5 GHz it is necessary to agree European standards for bandwidth, modulation technique, harmonic suppression and radiated power. 
5. Concerns electromagnetic compatibility. 
6. Comprises theoretical and experimental work to develop a methodology permitting the prediction of radiating cable performance on site on the basis of their commercial specifications. 
7. Measures and compares the results obtained from test sites chosen to be representative of different cable technologies. 
8. Synthesizes the results of the above workpackages.

16939;V1032;STRADA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Standardization of traffic data transmission and management;;;;"The main goals of this project are: 
- to describe the existing situation in the field of traffic data management and transmission in the whole Europe; 
- to conceive the functional specifications of a European traffic data integrated system; 
- to obtain agreement of competent authorities. 
These goals support the two following basic objectives: 
- to reduce cost of equipment by the way of specialisation and standardization; 
- to allow every authority, or professional user of traffic data, to have easy access to the information collected and stored everywhere in Europe.
At present, the exchange of road traffic data is restricted because of the absence of standards. A structured data dictionary, very close to a conceptual data model, has been developed which will allow people and systems to speak the same language. The associated use of a standardised query language (SQL) provides a complete set of tools for data exchange. The dictionary includes raw data, such as traffic flows or speeds, and information, such as incidents or weather.
A value added network is also proposed using the public wide area network (WAN) architecture and exclusively open standards. The system specifications have been worked out to build a flexible, open European network which would also enable users to use a single interface for every exchange. The users of such a network will include traffic control and traffic information centres, as well as editors, fleet operators, rescue corps, etc. The basic idea behind this system is that these organisations should exchange their data and information in a supplier client relationship. The architecture accordingly is a nonhierarchical one. Advanced functionalities, such as invoicing, have been provided for and communication protocols have been chosen in accordance with international standards.
Prototype software has been developed to be implemented in 5 computers in 5 countries with the main functions being available. The experimental network is made up of high level personal computers (PC) linked with X25 public networks.
A promising approach has been studied, which could be another way of generating SQL queries and receiving data, specially for organisations having no online computer and not being data suppliers. The EDIFACT syntax and the X400-500 standards could be the basis of another kind of access to traffic databases. A typical EDIFACT message has been developed as an example, but no software has been worked out on this basis.
The duration of the project will be eighteen months.  
This project constitutes the first step of the whole research described in task 506 of the DRIVE workplan. 
The first stage project will be to describe the existing situation of the studied field, the projects and the unsatisfied needs in Europe, including C.E.C., Scandinavia, Switzerland and Austria. At this end detailed surveys will be realised in all these countries by the different partners. They will try to reach an agreement on a standardization rather than solving a difficult technical problem. A reasonable convergence of existing and planned systems and methods will be looked for.

16933;V1044;FLEET;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Freight and Logistics Efforts for European Traffic;;;;"The project will analyse Fleet Management Systems in terms of market requirements (by region/sectors), will evaluate existing systems as well as socio-economic and private cost-benefits. On this basis the objectives and strategies for a feasible PAN-European FMS will be developed (top-down approach). Within the general system structure the operational goals and strategies at the different levels of management information, decision and control of the whole logistic processes are defined in detail. These levels are:

17029;A1015 (8311);SCP-ECG;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Standard Communications Protocol for Computerized Electrocardiography;;;;"The current proposal has been made to launch pre-normative research activities which should lead to a standard communications protocol for computerized electrocardiography. Having defined standards for ECG measurement and diagnostic programs with support of other EC Programmes, the proposed action aims specifically at the development of standards for interchange, encoding and storing of digital ECG data. 
A standard communications protocol was developed for computerized electrocardiography, consisting of standards for the interchange, encoding and storage of digital electrocardiogram (ECG) data. 3 distinct but related workpackages were carried out in close collaboration with representatives from academia and industry. Standards for the data content and format of the record to be transmitted, as well as messages and communication protocols were studied in the first workpackage. The data content and format have been defined for cart to host and host to host communication of digital ECG data. Also query request and different messages were defined for various users. Translation of the standard communications protocol (SCP) ECG communications protocol into the ASN.1 and EDIFACT syntax notation was worked out in first attempts for prototypes. For lower level open systems interconnection (OSI) layers (transport and below) existing standard profiles were recommended for transfer of digital ECG data. The second workpackage set out to agree on minimum performance requirements for the encoding of the signal. Previously published requirements were further refined in SCP-ECG. In workpackage 3 a conceptual reference model was developed for digital ECG data storage. The model was designed in modules around the concept of a relational database, which allowed various files of data to be linked via defined relations based on the entity relationship formalism. At the present time, this approach was preferred to object oriented data modelling, for which the technology is only emerging. The model is not dependent on any particular hardware and was constructed in a modular approach.
The first sub-goal of the project is to develop a universal protocol - a standard - for two-way digital ECG data transmission and communication between heterogeneous ECG computer systems. The standard shall document the logical format i.e. contents and data formats for such interchange. The standard will primarily deal with ISO/OSI level 7, the application and message content level, and will assume the existence of an underlying protocol to handle errors. However, it will include some error-checking, for simple computer-to-computer links that do not guarantee error-free transmission. The protocol shall according to CEN/CENELEC definitions and procedures for functional standards, document and list the various existing lower OSI level protocols which can be used to make the interchange between various systems possible. The standard shall enable any 2 systems to establish a link for communicating ECG signals, measurement and interpretation results, which shall be useful for clinical practice, administration and research in a comprehensive but flexible convention. 
The second sub-goal, which is intimately linked to the 1st and 3rd, aims to develop recommendations for digital ECG data encoding and compression. This shall take into account not only the exactness and efficiency of signal reconstruction, but also other arguments such as simplicity of the algorithms, costs of implementation, data integrity and privacy. 
The third sub-goal will aim at developing a conceptual reference model for digital ECG data storing. This will take into account the different objectives of such storage, and the technological media currently available and expected in the near future. 
Such a standardization task is difficult and can only be done by means of the international collaboration of clinicians, engineers and computer specialists. The currently developed island solutions can only be broken by including contributions and expertise from different university research centers with international reputation, industry and standardization organizations. This is the approach we want to follow in the current action.

16934;V1036;EVA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Evaluation process for Road Transport Informatics;;;;"To ensure that the evaluation of RTI projects and possible policies of implementation will be carried out using the same criteria and under the same assumptions, the project has defined eight objectives: 
To review transport and other relevant evaluation frameworks currently in use. 
To design an appropriate evaluation framework. 
To examine evaluation parameters currently in use. 
To examine relevant research and theoretical issues. 
To recommend parameters to be used with the proposed framework. 
To identify any research gap. 
To test framework on a contrasted set of projects. 
To incorporate experience gained from tests in revised framework. 
The consortium will design such an approach, taking into account the different views, experiences and disciplines of the partners. The result of cost/benefit analysis (in which costs and benefits are valued using `the measuring rod of money' supplemented by measures of performance), will be inserted into a framework of a multiple criteria oriented evaluation.
An evaluation framework for road transport informatics (RTI) has been developed. The general socioeconomic approach was discussed, an integrated methodology encompassing cost benefit and multicriteria analysis was developed, and common evaluation criteria and corresponding values were established. This framework served as the basis for the EVA computer program developed to perform easily all the evaluation calculations and sensitivity analyses. The EVA framework was validated by performing test evaluations with RTI applications from all areas of operational interest. The evaluation of scenarios of future transport systems and, in particular, of traffic information and control systems are an important step for future system implementation of road transport informatics into an integrated transport environment in Europe. This work can contribute to support the decision process by providing compatibility and transparency in the evaluation process.
In order to achieve the highest transparency, the physical effects of RTI will be assessed separately from the recommended values. 
A programme (which will run on a PC) will be developed to compute, simulate and estimate the effects of RTI. An important step will be the definition of interfaces with other DRIVE projects and the related data bank. 
In order to review the evaluation methodology, the consortium will try out the proposed evaluation framework against results coming from a set of projects selected from the DRIVE programme. The review will allow the testing, amongst other things, of (i) the degree of straining necessary to bring disparate elements into a unified analysis, and (ii) whether the methodology or the parameter values introduce a bias either toward particular types of project or toward some Community States. 
The review and revision will culminate in the production of a manual incorporating the specification of methods, assumptions, parameters and means of presentation that will ensure that the evaluation work is fully understood and reproducible.

16926;V1047;ODIN;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Origin-Destination Information vs Traffic Control;;;;"The goal of this project is to investigate methods to detect the Origin / Destination (O/D) information in real time and then to develop concepts to improve traffic control, both urban and extra-urban, according to that information.
Work has been carried out to investigate and developmethods and suitable algorithms for the online estimation of origin destination (O-D) information, then to develop new concepts of traffic control which use O-D information in order to improve transport efficiency for both urban and extraurban traffic. O-D estimation methods were developed first for urban intersections and linear motorways, and then extended to general road networks. Traffic control functions taking advantage of O-D information have been defined for both urban and motorway networks.

The research has focused on estimation techniques making use of data on the current state of traffic obtained from vehicle detectors (for example, inductive loops). Traffic surveillance and control systems providing other forms of data, perhaps from video cameras, have also been considered but in less detail. While static methods for O-D estimation have been considered, the investigation has focused on dynamic approaches where use is made of the information contained in the time series of traffic counts. This avoids, as much as possible, reliance on a priori information on the size of O-D flows and on assignment. Where a static approach appears to be most appropriate, the input of O-D data for subnetworks obtained by dynamic estimation has been considered.

Suitable schemes for traffic control using the dynamic O-D information have been investigated, taking into account the different levels of control (network or single junctions), for both urban and motorway traffic. Other uses of O-D information were also considered, in areas such as transport planning and operations.
The objective of improving road transport efficiency using O/D information by congestion prevention is pursued taking into account the evolution of traffic control system architectures from conventional UTC systems with sensors (mainly inductive loops) to more advanced systems with new technologies. The project intends to develop all topics regarding the O/D achievement from UTC systems (except from route guidance systems) and the use of this information for traffic control actions. 
After a review of the existing methods the project will predict urban and extra-urban traffic by mean of O/D information obtained from more and more enhanced systems and will provide O/D for urban transport planning. The levels of UTC systems examined will be conventional systems, route guidance (only link) and KBS. The use of O/D as input for control actions in order to prevent congestion will follows and at the end a global evaluation of efficiency from O/D utilisation is expected as well as the possible integration between urban and extra-urban approaches will be analysed.

16943;V1026;INVAID;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Integration of Computer Vision Techniques for Automatic Incident Detection;;;;"The main objective of the project is to develop an integrated congestion and incident detection system which will incorporate computer vision techniques. This system will be designed to be a sub-system of a wider traffic control system to be developed by other DRIVE projects. The module developed by this project will have the option of using image processing either centrally or locally.
The INVAID system is an automatic traffic incident detection system for both motorway and urban network applications which uses computer vision techniques. The system involves the automatic digitising, processing and interpretation of pictures from roadside closed circuit television cameras. INVAID incorporates 2 of the leading methodologies specifically designed for the analysis of live road traffic images at two levels: IMPACTS (UCL) and TITAN (INRETS). The INVAID project has designed algorithms that perform automatic incident detection based on data output using these two techniques at both individual sensor (ie television camera) level and at system wide, multiple camera level.

The objective of the central system (CS) is to collect information transferred by highway surveillance cameras in order to provide a spatial instantaneous description of the state of the traffic, as well as the temporal evolution of incidents and traffic conditions detected by sensors and to make this information available to the operator. This interpretation offers a potential for detecting both directly visible incidents within the real camera road segment (RCS) and for detecting abnormalities that may be the result of an incident elsewhere (ie in a road segment not covered by cameras, the virtual camera road segment (VCS)). The main internal functional modules are:
a communication interface to provide the link between the CS and all installed local sensor modules (LSM) and data collection services;
a decision making process for short and long term processing of incoming data;
a man machine interface module (MMI) located at the top level of the system hierarchy to make all the system's capabilities easily accessible and controllable by the user. The MMI provides a graphical environment in which a great amount of information can be displayed to the user.

The local sensor module (LSM) performs the image processing and computer vision procedures necessary for automatic incident detection. Each LSM is attached to one video camera. Its main task is to provide alarms for incidents occurring in the camera field of view or nearby. There are 2 types of sensors called Type A and Type B.

The Type A sensor is based on a TRISTAR like image processing module and it was developed by INRETS. It primarily aims at detecting incidents that occur within or nearby the camera field of view (usually, several hundred meters of motorway are covered by one camera). It does not produce only a binary alarm but provides a more detailed information such as there is an incident of type T or the confidence level of this alarm is C. In addition, the local system acts as a traffic sensor and calculates a set of traffic measurements such as volumes, velocities and concentration. Other optional functions of the system (eg communication, image compression and transmission) are related more to industrial problems rather than to research.

The Type B processor is based upon a particular computer vision technique, IMPACTS, researched and developed at University College London. The incoming surveillance camera images are processed to give a spatial description of some of the basic traffic characteristics. This description is of a qualitative nature and aims to reflect the behaviour of the traffic directly. It does not produce the classical measures of traffic flow, detector occupancy and speed which are found by aggregating data from vehicle detection. The spatial description output from the Type B algorithm shows where within the image of the road there is moving, stationary and no traffic. Information is also sought from existing conventional detectors and from a small database. By combining this information, robustness of the incident detection should be improved.

The main objective of the research, entitled project INVAID, was to develop an automatic incident detection system for both, motorway and urban network application, using computer vision techniques. Others objectives were:
to identify and produce a standard classification of incident types for traffic behaviour on motorway and urban roads;
to develop suitable techniques that will combine computer vision, existing traffic data and other relevant data to provide a robust system;
to design a man machine interface that will allow a traffic controller to rapidly understand the data presented by the system and take the appropriate action.

The INVAID system uses computer vision techniques and is primarily concerned with the interpretation of the image processorsinformation and the preparation of information to be sent to operators. The system comprises 3 processing modules to detect and interpret incidents:
2 local sensor modules (LSM) that takes input from the cameras situated at road side sites;
the central system module that takes the input from the LSMs and additional information from other ATT systems.

The principal elements of the INVAID Type B processing module for automatic traffic incident detection on high speed roads is described. High speed roads are dual carriageways, multilane highways where stopping is only permitted in emergencies, or only occurs as a direct consequence of an emergency or congestion. Permitted traffic speeds are normally greater than 100 kilometres per hour and intersections are grade separated.

The Type B processor is based upon a particular computer vision technique, IMPACTS, researched and developed at University College London. The incoming surveillance camera images are processed to give a spatial description of some of the basic traffic characteristics. This description is of a qualitative nature and aims to reflect the behaviour of the traffic directly. It does not produce the classical measures of traffic flow, detector occupancy and speed which are found by aggregating data from vehicle detection.

The Type B processor is envisaged as being located at a control centre, with video images being transmitted from remote cameras. Multiple cameras would each have their own associated Type B processor which would then be fed into the central system.

The techniques developed were implemented in the laboratory on a SUN workstation based system. The Type B algorithms run entirely on software in the SUN and have been written in C. Several trial runs have been carried out using real time video recordings of various high speed road scenes, some of which included incidents. In one example the traffic goes from free flowing to congested, and then an accident occurs at the far end of the view. The Type B output, shown as a text string, correctly logs this sequence of events.

The main objective of the research was to develop and automatic incident detection system for both, motorway and urban network application, using computer vision techniques. Computer vision involves the automatic digitizing, processing and interpretation of pictures from roadside closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. The system developed comprises 3 main modules:
2 data/image processing modules, each using different camera arrangements, image processing and algorithms;
the central system which takes its input from the data/image processing modules and from other road transport informatics (RTI) systems.

The automatic incident detection system has the following advantages:
the road area observed is increased from 2 to 3 metres to 200 to 300 metres;
an artificial intelligence (AI) approach broadens the range of traffic conditions over which effective incident detection can be performed;
external information from existing sensor systems about the nature of the highway and temporary changes, such as roadworks, can be incorporated into the rule based approach allowing a greater flexibility of used;
the information returned by the basic sensing device, a video camera, is readily understood by human traffic controllers.
The principal objectives of this project can be summarised as follows: 
- to identify and produce a standard classification of incident types motorway and urban networks, 
- to utilise computer vision techniques to provide new spatial measures of traffic behaviour on motorways and urban roads, 
- to develop artificial intelligence techniques that will combine computer vision, existing traffic data and other relevant data to provide a robust automatic incident detection system for both motorway and urban networks, 
- to design a man-machine interface that will allow a traffic controller to rapidly assimilate the data presented by the system and take the appropriate remedial action, 
- to monitor the development of other RTI systems and specify interfaces between them and this system. This will enable the system under development in this project to be incorporated into wider traffic control systems, 
- to evaluate the performance of the system in field trials.

18766;A1004 (8501);HELIOS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Hospital Environment Language within an Information Object System;;;;"The motivation of the project HELIOS (Hospital Environment Language within an Information Object System) is to create a Software Engineering Environment (SEE) to alleviate the development of medical applications software. The resulting systems can be viewed as a layer above an operating system providing services to the application designer, and finally to the application end-user. 
A software engineering environment has been created to facilitate the development of medical applications. This consisted of a set of software components, communicating through an abstract channel called Software Bus, providing services to the application designer, and finally to the application end user. The kernel comprised 3 main software components, the information system, the documentation facilities, and a component providing a convenient user interface, the interface manager. The services consist of a collection of toolkits providing the necessary services to medical applications which are represented by an image processing toolbox. The object oriented paradigm was used both as a methodology for modelling the entities and procedures found in an application and as the basic structure for building the software components. Development standards included UNIX as operating system and X Window/MOTIF as windowing environment. The target application for the prototype was the development of a hospital ward information system with its ward image manipulation subsystem. A first prototype has been completed. A first version of the Software Bus was written in ANSI C using the XDR [10] representation protocol for UNIX based workstations. The information system presently relies on the GemStone object oriented database management system. Methods associated with software objects and the medical object library were written in OPAL. The interface manager developed in ANSI C presently includes the image, text, program, object, graph and chart editors. The image editor gives access to the image processing toolbox also written in ANSI C. The interface of the documentation facilities was developed with INGRES Window-4GL and the corresponding nodes stored in a relational INGRES data base.
The structure of the system is made of three main components : first, a framework for tool integration and communication (the kernel), second, a collection of integrated tools providing the necessary services to the medical application designers (the services) and third, a component which provides the application user with a convenient user support interface (the interface). 
On one hand, the recent development of object management systems, combining the power of object programming and the efficient management of data, provides a valuable approach to the design of a computer-aid SEE and the project will take into account recent development in object management systems and in Artificial Intelligence (AI). On the other hand, medical decision support applications involve information of different natures (images, text, ...) which are often available in different formats and media. Thus, this context implies special requirements in terms of data representation and manipulation. The planification of the project includes several steps : 
- Our first interest will be to study existing object management systems, and to select one of them according to its functionalities but also its portability and extendibility. 
- Then, the selected Information System will be adapted to the specifications of medical applications requirements : (the possibility to make logical inferences, inheritance of characteristics, the expression of relationships, the representation and manipulation of imprecision and uncertainty or the representation of temporal as well as spatial information, ...). 
- In the meantime, medical applications will be considered and will help to the specifications of requirements. The main one, called Ward Information System concerns the interaction between physicians and ward staff on one hand and complex various entities known as complex medical objects on the other hand, for instance diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, investigation and patient management. It includes an Image Based Medical Subsystem since the management of medical image will take a more and more important part in the medical management of patients. Specific examples will deal with the visualization of anatomical objects in tomographic image sequences.

16930;V1041;GIDS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Generic Intelligent Driver Support;;;;"The overall objective of the project is to determine the requirements and design standards for a class of intelligent co-driver systems. Such systems will, as far as possible, have to be consistent with the information requirements and performance capabilities of the human driver.
The overall objective of the project is to determine the requirements and design standards for a class of intelligent codriver (GIDS) systems, which will be maximally consistent with the information requirements and performance capabilities of the human driver. The project will provide recommendations for such systems, and a (limited) operational prototype to demonstrate the essential features of the GIDS concept.
The driving task is divided in 3 major task levels: planning, manoeuvring and control. The GIDS system will incorporate support functions at each of these levels and provide instructional support to novice drivers. Given its aim of implementing the GIDS concept in a realistic, if limited prototype, a small set of driving (sub) tasks has been selected for in depth study, including lane following, merging into a traffic stream and overtaking. Criteria for inclusion were the possibility of algorithmically describing that task and its dependence on more than one of the support functions. Driving takes place in a complex, dynamic environment, the road system. The project will provide recommendations for driver support in a wide variety of driving circumstances. At the same time a minimally relevant small world environment has been defined for indepth study. The GIDS prototype will be required to operate in this small world. The driver will interact with the GIDS system by means of a variety of displays and controls, including voice communication and a touch sensitive screen. Specifically it will include intelligent control (accelerator pedal and steering wheel). The functional architecture of GIDS includes a script based analyst/planner which accepts information from devoted front end systems and a dialogue controller that regulates the communication between the driver and various system components. The actual hardware to be used will largely consist of components that are already available. A bus architecture will be developed with the dialogue controller as server.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The aim of the research was to review some functional characteristics of generic intelligent driver support (GIDS) systems. The purpose of GIDS systems is to provide an intelligent, electronic codriver. Codrivers are human or artificial systems which support vehicle operators during task performances, by providing them with information in the form of warnings, advice, or intervention under a range of critical circumstances, and particularly in case of emergency. The intelligent codriver should even be able to take into account the intentions, the capabilities and the limitations of the human at the wheel.

Basic codriver support functions, showing an increasing amount of adaptive control, include:
enhancing information (eg increasing visibility by retroflection);
augmentation (eg special information about icy patches);
warning (eg against speeding or other violations);
advice (to take a less congested route);
explanation (eg reason for delay);
instruction (eg feedback about incorrect action);
intervention (eg speed delimiter);
substitute or secondary control (eg cooperative driving);
autonomous or primary control (eg robot driving).

It is included that the present state of development of GIDS systems will provide a shell for future applications and extensions of the concept of intelligent driver support. In addition, the technological push toward automation should make us close our eyes to the fact that for a very long time to come human drivers will continue to share the responsibility of dealing with incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory information, and that of making correct decisions under many and extreme conditions GIDS systems could also be extended to other road user categories (eg motorcyclists, truck drivers) and is particularly suited to disabled road users.

The aim of the research behavioural factors in generic intelligent driver support (GIDS) systems was to deliver a set of basic and functional recommendations for GIDS. Driver support on the level of navigation, manoeuvering and vehicle control were all considered in an interrelated way. Rather than focusing on the separate functioning of these support components GIDS systems integrate information from all 3 levels, thus indicating what items to present to the driver, what to combine or suppress, what level of urgency is required, what functions to allocate to the driver or, in the case of driver instruction, what instruction should be given to the driver.

The first results of behavioural studies into GIDS systems and their consequences for the design of the GIDS prototype are described. The behavioural studies focused on 2 issues:
the description of baseline behaviour;
the analysis of the effects of particular support functions.
The results of the baseline studies gave a description of unsupported behaviour (eg the information processing and behavioural characteristics of unsupported driving). These data will serve as a reference in the GIDS systems to indicate whether and how a supportive action is needed. The results of simulation and car studies with instrumentation on the effects of supportive actions can be used to indicate the actual effects of a particular type of support at a particular moment. From these preliminary evaluation studies recommendations were derived concerning the support characteristics of GIDS. This lead to specific requirements for the driver vehicle interface and the design of a GIDS dialogue controller and analyst planner.

The research investigated the way in which driver skills develop both during and after formal training with the aim of evaluating the usefulness to training and experienced motorists of generic intelligent driver support (GIDS) systems. In particular the development of a system to augment the limited driving related feedback available to drivers from the real world was investigated and a prototype of such a system, called the personalized support and learning module (PSALM), was built. It was concluded that only systems which are both truly intelligent and truly generic can really aid learning after formal driver training has ceased.

The research investigated:
the role of mandatory driver training;
the effects of driver training;
the acquisition of driving skills;
the relationship between learning and knowledge;
the relationship between practice and automation;
the use of rules;
changes in driver behaviour;
changes in accident involvement;
changes in performance.
In order to achieve the goal of the project, the following objectives shall be achieved: 
- define the detailed functional requirements of generic intelligent driver support systems (GIDS), 
- determine the impact of new RTI systems on the driver's perception of the prevailing road and traffic situation, 
- determine the nature and format of the interactive communication between the driver and the new RTI systems, including systems for adaptive feedback, 
- develop the hardware and software for a prototype GIDS system. The prototype shall incorporate the most important features of the final GIDS system, 
- determine the impact of GIDS systems on road safety, efficiency, training needs and determine their acceptability, 
- demonstrate the validity of the GIDS concept in field tests.

16947;V1030;PAMELA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Pricing and Monitoring Electronically of Automobiles;;;;"The main goal of this project is the development and testing of a microwave link for automatic two-way data-communication between vehicles and the roadside. The potential of such a link for use for vehicle identification, monitoring, control and road pricing is very great. Many of the technical advances in the RTI field will depend upon the successful outcome of this research. In seeking to develop and test a suitable data-communications link that is reliable, robust, secure and immune from environmental disturbances, the partners in this project are united in the view that microwave technology is the most appropriate medium. An early decision will be required, however, on the most suitable frequency on which to standardize for the main applications envisaged.
Equipment has been developed to facilitate 2-way data communication between a moving vehicle and a fixed roadside station for nonstop automatic debiting applications such as road tolling, road use pricing and car parking. The heart of the system is a reliable high capacity, short range microwave communications link. Above all, the link must be reliable and have the ability to allow communications between roadside beacons and vehicles' transponders at high speed (up to 160 km/hour) in both a single lane and unrestricted multilane environment. The onboard unit consists of a small size transponder mounted in the windscreen of a vehicle, which will contain the necessary communications circuits and a dedicated microprocessor, as well as the ability to interface to other peripheral equipment in the vehicle (ie smart card reader, display, keyboard, central processing unit, sensors, etc.
2 important areas of application were chosen for the demonstration tests, namely, automatic tolling and parking control and pricing. These probably represent the most immediate and promising areas of Europewide application of this technology. However, future applications of the technology, such as cordon based road use pricing and congestion monitoring and pricing, have also been catered for in the design.
A prototype was made available on 08/25/92

The aim of the research programme, entitled PAMELA (pricing and monitoring electronically of automobiles), was to devise a generic automatic debiting system which will be able to support a number of different applications such as road tolling, road pricing and car parking debiting. The system which was developed consists of 3 different modules:
a physical interface between the roadside and vehicle equipment (microwave data link);
the transponders, logic circuits and other in vehicle equipment;
the roadside charging station and central control interface.

The following field trials are performed on the system:
high speed, nonstop, automatic tolling by prepayment;
on street car parking debiting and management;
multivehicle, multilane communications for road use pricing in free flow, high speed traffic.
The project comprises a coherent set of tasks that runs right across the DRIVE programme, from strategy through system-specification, design and fabrication to eventual testing in the field. Thus, a main task (T118) involves the strategic context of overall demand-management of traffic, within which the more detailed considerations of vehicle-identification, monitoring and automatic debiting will be implemented. Likewise, another main task (T331) provides scope for the further research and development of the microwave system to achieve a full two-way capability with the necessary accuracy, range and bandwidth. This will enable developed prototype systems to be incorporated in the field-trials that are planned, to demonstrate their performance under real traffic conditions. 
Alongside the technical research and development work, therefore, substantial resources will go into the specification and design of these field-trials, so that the feasibility of this new communications-link can be tested. Two important areas of application have been chosen for the demonstration tests: namely, automatic tolling (T312/T331) and parking control and pricing (T312/331). These probably represent the most immediate and promising areas of Europe-wide application using this technology. Finally, the results of monitoring each of these field-tests will be evaluated to establish, in broad social cost-benefit terms, the likely returns from large-scale investment in this new technology to tackle RTI problems. 
Finally, although the project will not cover the crucial issue of standards and protocols (i.e. Tasks T505-T508), individual members of the consortium are involved in international working parties that are confronting these questions. The concern of the consortium as a whole is that, in the general desire to standardize, far-reaching decisions, particularly as regards the microwave frequency to be adopted, are not reached too soon. A major report on this would be presented for the first year's annual review.

16965;V1008;STRATEGIES;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Strategies for Integrated Demand Management Systems;;;;"The overall objective of the project is to develop control strategies to be implemented in the integrated demand management systems proposed for congested European cities. This project will look at how automatic vehicle identification (AVI) and other RTI technologies can be applied to road pricing and other traffic restraint policies in an integrated approach to demand management.
A number of strategies were developed for demand management which could potentially be used in European cities. These were developed taking account of international experience with a full range of possible measures reviewed at the start of the project. In particular, the potential impacts and effectiveness of individual measures were considered, together with the extent to which measures were complementary and reinforced each others' effects. The 4 strategies were a combination of existing approaches, a toll cordon, comprehensive road pricing and vehicle based points.
The objective behind the combination of existing approaches strategy was to devise a demand management strategy that makes best use of existing traffic management measures. There are various ways in which road traffic informatics (RTI) could enhance the operation of this type of strategy. For example: stored value or smart cards could be used for automatic payment of on street and off street parking charges; and a dynamic car parking charging system could be deployed, in which parking charges are linked in real time to the level of demand.
The second strategy, toll cordon, wasessentially a simplified road pricing strategy. Traffic levels in the central city area would be regulated through the imposition of a charge for entering the central area, at certain times of day. The strategy would be RTI-based, but would allow for manual payment by occasional users or visitors.
The third strategy went further than strategy 2 and comprised highly RTI orientated comprehensive road pricing. In this strategy, the project proposed a semicontinuous charging system based on a fine network of charging cells throughout the urban area. Coupled with electronic road pricing would be a series of complementary measures.
As with the simpler toll cordon strategy, there would be certain categories of vehicles or persons that would be exempt from the charges.
Under the vehicle based points strategy, each vehicle would be al located a fixed number of units for travel during the regulated times of day, over a period of one month. This would allow each driver considerable flexibility in choosing when to use his/her share of scarce road space resources through a nonfiscal points system.

A model called ORIENT was utilised within the strategic level evaluation. This is an attempt to get macroscopic traffic information by using microscopic and mesoscopic simulation techniques. ORIENT includes all steps of the classic 4-stage transportation planning models. It combines an activity based approach with a traffic flow model. 3 types of input data are required, as follows, description of the study network with the desired level of detail, description of the zones of the study area and description of the activity programmes.
In order to evaluate the potential effects of the strategies, a number of extensions were made to the ORIENT model to account for response to demand management measures. These include: destination choice, which depends on the attractiveness of activity facilities as well as on the travel modes available; departure time for an activity, which depends on the duration of the activity before, and the duration of the journey and route choice, influenced by the expected journey time and costs. The most important mode for journeys made between all sectors was the private car, even for trips beginning and ending in the city centre. By introducing combined existing measures to influence travel behaviour, the number of trips by car fell and public transport was used more frequently. There was also a shift towards cycling and walking.
Road pricing accentuated these trends. It appeared to have a very strong effect on mode choice, with one third of car drivers changing their mode and transferring primarily to public transport, but also to car pooling. The direct pricing of car use led also to more cycling and walking. The vehicle based points strategy resulted in a shift towards car pooling, at the expense of public transport and cycling, and a slight drop in car driver trips. It is apparent that road pricing has the greatest impact on travel patterns, leading to the largest reduction in car use and a strong shift to cycling and car passenger mode s.
On the basis of these findings, it might be worth considering some form of hybrid approach, combining elements of vehicle based points and road pricing strategies. The scope for doing this will in part depend on the particular road traffic informatics (RTI) environment available in a city.

The road transport informatics (RTI) technology options for integrated demand management systems were reviewed and assessed. The applicability of a number of technologies was considered within the framework for integrated demand management systems. These included the following technologies: automatic vehicle identification and roadside vehicle communications systems; onboard computers and card systems and automatic enforcement systems. Within the project an integrated system design was developed for implementing the demand management strategies.
The preferred system design for an integrated demand management system basically comprises dedicated roadside equipment linked into a telecommunications network and central processing units. The system fulfils 2 functions, namely, implementation of the demand management measures and enforcement of compliance with those measures. Automatic vehicle identification (AVI) or roadside vehicle communications (RVC) systems form a key part of the preferred design, backed up by automated enforcement systems.
In determining the best system design, a number of functional requirements were considered in the project. These included requirements in the areas of privacy, enforcement, security, account control, accuracy and reliability, cost and complexity, user information and convenience, system administration, exemptions and visiting vehicles and compatibility with other integrated road transplant environment (IRTE) functions.
In order to fulfil the range of requirements for demand management, the preferred system design is highly flexible and supports a range of technological options. It is based principally on 2-way RVC technology with on vehicle accounting and an off vehicle audit trail for extra security. However, the system also allows some vehicles to operate with off vehicle accounting. In the preferred system design, every AVI/RVC tag would have a unique fixed tag identification (ID) number which is transmitted from the vehicle to the roadside reader at every charging site.
Enforcement within the system would involve use of charge coupled device (CCD) cameras at the debiting sites linked to frame store and mass storage devices. Vehicles detection equipment would be installed at each outstation, based around inductive loop presence sensors. The frame store device would then be activated to freeze frames of passing vehicles whenever a violating vehicle is detected.
The principal advantage of an active system over a purely passive system design is that it reduces the complexity and cost of the central computer system by distributing the main accounting functions to the on-vehicle units. The active system encompasses 2 fully compatible options, these are either smart AVI/RVC tags or AVI/RVC tags incorporating smart card technology. Drivers would be free to choose either type of unit, but would need to pay the additional cost associated with a smart card unit, in return for its potential extra convenience.

Technologies applicable to demand management schemes have been investigated in the project. An integrated system suited to implementing a range of strategies has also been developed. This is a highly flexible system and should give maximum performance at least cost, while taking account of a wide range of needs and requirements. The preferred system design for an integrated demand management system basically comprises dedicated roadside equipment linked into a telecommunicationsnetwork and central processing units. Automatic vehicle identification or roadside vehicle communications systems form a key part of the design, backed up by automated enforcement systems.
Research carried out in the project showed that integrated demand management strategies and systems should be applied to address the congestion problems particular to a city. This means targeting spatial or temporal redistribution of demand to alleviate the most severe congestion problems without imposing unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of the public to travel.
Integrated demand management systems should be used in European cities when urban congestion has reached, or is predicted to reach, an unacceptable level. Particular locations where integrated demand management systems are appropriate include historic cities with high traffic levels. Above all, integrated demand management systems will be most effective where there is broad social and political consensus behind the strategy. The social and political considerations are therefore at least as important as technical and operational considerations in implementing any demand management scheme.
In particular, this project will aim to answer four important questions: 
- why should integrated demand management systems be used in congested European cities? 
- what should integrated demand management systems comprise? 
- how should integrated demand management systems be applied? 
- when and where should integrated demand management systems be used in Europe and under what conditions of use will such systems be most effective?

The aim of the concept is that the education can take place via standard ISDN- connection (2 x 64 Kbit/s \ 1 x 16 Kbit/s for audio, picture and data).
Computer conferencing cooperation Aarhus (CCCA) has finished version 1.8.7 of a computer conferencing system, the Electronic Informations Exchange System II (EIES 2). EIES 2 provides an integrated collection of tools for defining and operating computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. Facilities are provided to tailor group communication facilities and user interfaces in a network environment. Standard applications layer protocols for remote operations are used to support a distributed database of communication objects in an arbitrary network of application entities. EIES 2 provides its own distributed Smalltalk environment for CSCW application development. This maps well onto the network environment of CSCW and provides for a high degree of security. The object model is extremely well suited to CSCW development.

17037;A 1036 (8323);MIMI;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Medical Workstation for Intelligent Interactive Acquisition and Analysis of Digital Medical Images;;;;"This project aims to define the functional requirements for a workstation for use with Medical Images derived from Multiple Modes such as Nuclear Medicine, Ultrasound, Digital Subtraction Angiography, Digital Cardiac Imaging, CT, MRI, etc. All of the modes are available in digital format at some point between acquisition and display. The workstation will be interactive and allow a form of image processing appropriate to each modality occur at it. Hence it will be necessary to investigate the range of digital formats in which data is presently available and to define the problems involved in accessing and using such data.
Research has been undertaken to define a functional specification of a multimodal imaging workstation for use with those imaging modalities in which, at some point between capture and display, the image is available in digital form. An evaluation of the requirements of such a workstation was made in relation to the computer architecture, data pathways, image formats, direct accessibility of data, and availability and utilization of image manipulation and processing functions on currently used image acquisition systems. It was found that the architecture of the majority of such systems are based on industry standard computer hardware but that the image formats vary from system to system. Neither the hardware nor the image data conform to the proposed standards on medical image formats. There is a wide variation in the number of image manipulation and processing functions provided and their utilization. A specification for an imaging workstation was derived by a consideration of 6 factors: the functions performed; input and output modes; system structure; user interface; equipment configuration; and software requirements. Clinical studies were performed to investigate whether the diagnostic process could be improved by introducing added functionality into the single modality image interpretation systems presently available. These studies were extended to an evaluation of multimodality image interpretation systems using a test platform. The conclusion was reached that it is practical to produce an imaging workstation, at modest cost, which would be suitable for clinical multimodality use and have a high level of functionality. It was concluded that the definition of the function and role of imaging workstations is far from clear, and that there is a requirement for a workstation such as that proposed to fill the gap that exists in workstation development.
The proposed workstation will have various levels of software. The first two of these are those conventionally associated with image processing and the special packages required by each imaging technology. In addition, the special problems that arise from the way in which physicians, radiologists, cardiologists et al., interact with the data will be investigated, and will be defined to the extent that they must inevitably contribute to the statement of the human and technical requirements of a workstation as a whole. These studies can inevitably be complex and hence they will initially be clustered around particular sets of clinical data, such as cardiac, renal or gastro-enterological problems, to allow specific solutions emerge.

17031;A (8808);QAMS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Quality Assurance of Medical Standards;;;;"!!A project has been carried out to address the issues of software quality assurance (SQA) in medical contexts by:
developing a set of basic user requirements for computer systems used in various branches of clinical physiology, aimed at improving the design aspects of medical software;
developing a general methodology for good manufacturing practice in medical informatics aimed at improving the production aspects;
compiling a library of clinically validated reference data filer, aimed at improving the field testing and validation aspects of nuclear medicine (NM) SQA specifically. Integrated documents were produced on the following topics:
user requirements for data systems in physiological measurements;
user requirements for data systems in nuclear medicine;
good manufacturing practice in medical information systems. In addition, a draft procedure for thorough testing/validation of nuclear medicine software has been developed, based on the use of software phantoms. A new logical format for NM image files has been specifically developed which should enable a practical system for the transfer of data (ie software phantoms) between different NM computer systems. Such a system is at an advanced stage of development. A suitable mechanism for developing the user specifications and SQA procedures into European standards was identified and initial steps in the procedure taken. A general philosophy for European standards development for medical software was set out in the final report. When the NM project is completed, the software phantoms will be made available to all NM departments as part of a standardised quality control procedure, allowing thorough testing of nuclear medicine software for the first time. The ability to transfer clinical NM images between different computer systems could have important implications for NM software development in general, since it will allow easy exchange of any clinical image data between users in different centres, thereby aiding collaborative research.
Our specific proposal on physiological measurements by nuclear medicine : development of software quality assurance standards has been made more general for two reasons. First in the discussion with the AIM principals, coordination with the other T734 proposal was requested. That proposal 'MASQUES' deals with general approaches to software standards, needs analysis, surveys of software standardization and planning study, including seminars with medical practitioners, whereas our initial proposal identified a specific specialist user problem in nuclear medicine, and we are able to bring together much wider user experience in the field of hospital information systems. Secondly out particular combination of medical doctors, physicists and computer software experts means that we are able to estimate and critically assess the consequences to the specific users of general approaches to software standards. Our particular expertise draws on the experience of Nordic groups Nord med tek and with the Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover. This expertise is able to achieve the following deliverables. 
1. An evaluation of existing work on software quality assurance in the fields set out 3 or 4 below. 
2. Production of a background memorandum on Quality Assurance of Hospital Information systems and principles for good manufacturing practice in medical software. 
3. Define the user requirement for quality assurance standards in : 
 Nuclear Medicine 
 Anaesthesia 
 Intensive Care. 
4. Define the user requirements for quality assurance standards subsequently in :

16941;V1034;RIMES;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Road Information and Management Euro-System;;;;"The project aims to: 
- provide comprehensive specifications to enable existing and future road information and management systems to contribute to European needs as well as serve the local requirements; 
- ensure appropriate links between the road databases and other related systems, e.g. for vehicle navigation, traffic management, route planning, etc.
Many road administrations and associated consultants within the European community are already well advanced in the process of developing sophisticated spatially related road information and management systems. These systems will not only revolutionise the approach to road safety and the management of the road infrastructure in the 1990's, but could have significant implications for the DRIVE initiative. However, current developments, although all addressing the same broad issues, lack an overall view and generally confine their attention to local or national needs. Therefore, the aim of or the road information and management Euro-system (RIMES) is firstly to examine the situation and establish the high level wider view parameters that all systems could and should incorporate irrespective of frontier. Secondly, the RIMES project will study and develop directives and standards for the construction of the road databases (RDB) for the use of administrations managing a road network.
To attain these objectives, it is proposed to: take an across the board look at current developments followed by an in depth study of the major development sites, identify the information needs of a feasible European system and validate the issued information model on existing RDB implementations and other DRIVE projects issues, produce a road data base conceptual model representing the common real life situation at road administrations, formulate the technical specifications which could enable road administrations to provide information at a European level, identify or develop communication standards for the interchange of information between road databases and the other related developments of the DRIVE programme and formulate guidelines on a classification to define the quality and the accuracy of data in the frame of the interface with otherproducts.
The research led to the design of a road administation data exchange format (RADEF) developed during a specific project. The RADEF was tested against several RDB sites in Europe. A prototype was made available from November 1996.

The aim of the research was to reconcile the already large (but disparate) investment of road administrations in Europe in the domain of road information and management database systems with the requirements of European road transport informatics (RTI) systems. The first stage was the completion of an in depth survey of the current situation within Europe as far as public administrations and RTI are concerned. A picture emerged of a nonuniform spread of activity. There was heavy investment and similar long term objectives but little common as far as a technical database was concerned.

Following the survey a complete data analysis opened the way to the design of a conceptual data model which has been validated against different public administration road databases (RDB). During the same period an evaluation of road network referencing requirements revealed that the emerging Geometric Data File (GDF) standard would be unlikely to fully accommodate all the perceived needs of public administrations. The research led to the design of a road administration data exchange format (RADEF) standard which would be as close as possible to GDF but extended to incorporate the special requirements of public administrations. The combination of RADEF and GDF together would add immeasurably to the contribution and therefore value of the road administration databases within an integrated road transport environment.
To achieve the objectives the project will: 
- take an 'across the board' look at current developments followed by an in-depth study of the major development sites; 
- identify the information needs of a feasible pan-European system; 
- formulate the technical specifications which would enable road administrations to provide information at a European level; 
- to formulate standards for the spatial relationship of data (network referencing); 
- develop communication standards and tools for the interchange of information between road databases and related developments coming out of the DRIVE Programme.

17028;A1043 (8002 + 8222 + 8516);PRECISE;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Prospects for Extra-mural and Clinical Information Systems Environment;;;;"Research has been carried out on various medical workstations in order to combine powerful graphics with user friendly access in a clinical environment. 3 different concepts were considered: a consulting room system; a medical workstation; and a ward information system. For the development of the consulting room system, 2 workshops took place. It was found that there was a high degree of common ground amongst the clinical functions in the consulting rooms of different European countries. Emphasis was placed on the user's rather than the engineers point of view. A detailed report was produced to list the technologies, methods and techniques that are needed for the infrastructure to develop a multi media workstation for a general practitioner, and to list the different technologies by their potential usefulness. The results provide the basis for the implementation of medical workstations in the environments of the project partners. For the medical workstation project a prototype was built and a workstation implemented in a limited domain (that of cardiology). This prototype was developed in close collaboration with clinicians, statisticians and epidemiologists. A flexible software architecture was designed and implemented which successfully addressed the problems of integrating software and data under a common user friendly interface. The architecture is valid in other areas of clinical research and generally applicable in medical information processing. The ward information system project involved a global exploration of the functional, integration and standardization aspects of data entry and information retrieval facilities supporting the nurses' daily routine on clinical wards. Central to the project was the use of beside workstations. This exploratory survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire which was not able to generate a complete overview.
The project is a combination of three proposals concerning integration of functions in a medical workstation. The three parts are concerned with departmental management and research, nursing and primary care. Specifications of functions and interfaces will be developed. Intelligent user interfaces will be considered.

16967;V1010;PANDORA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Prototyping A Navigation Database of Road-network Attributes;;;;"The project will prototype a database containing information on a road network linked to a digital map. The prototype will cover parts of two major British cities and their connecting roads, using data obtained from large scale maps and other sources. Such a map, with the additional information it contains, would be used for vehicle navigation, vehicle location and other traffic / transportation purposes.
Project PANDORA has prototyped the methodology and systems for extracting and integrating digital road network data with traffic related attribute data. Test data for the London to Birmingham travel corridor in the United Kingdom has been used in field trials of vehicle navigation systems and supplied to the European benchmark test. The project has resulted in recommendations for improvements both to the Geometric Data File (GDF) standard for digital road networks and to legal measures for the protection of data providers.
Key issues involved were the application of existing GDF draft standards and recommendations for improvement, development of extraction/data capture and integration methodologies, development of a comprehensive and reusable data model using structured design methods, geographical referencing of digital road networks and their numbering, creation of a test data set, field trials of test data using new navigation products, recommendations for legal protection of data providers and pointers to requirements for commercial services.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The objective of the research was to create and test a prototype road navigation database. Digital street networks were extracted mainly from the Ordnance Survey's large scale digital mapping and the necessary road and traffic attributes were collected independently. These data were integrated into a specially designed prototype database for parts of London and Birmingham and the major interconnecting roads. This dataset was then tested in field trials using prototype vehicle navigation systems.

The research led to the following conclusions:
production of integrated large scale digital road network data is a complex and time consuming process and it is easy to underestimate the amount of work involved;
the data used has been extensively validated and shown to be of good quality and accuracy;
laboratory testing and field trials have demonstrated the successful use both of navigation systems and of the data;
the technical processes, framework and data model for the supply, integration and testing of digital road network data which have been developed appear to form a sound basis for the creation of a much larger panEuropean digital road network database.
The project will develop the required data structures and demonstrate a methodology for extracting road network data from a digital map database. The work will include: 
a) integrating map and traffic related attribute data (taking full account of the GDF standard defined by DEMETER); 
b) demonstration of the use of such integrated map and traffic data in field trials using prototype autonomous and infrastructure-based navigation systems. 
c) provision of the UK element (Task 12) of the Benchmark Test. 
The project will apply, develop and publish standards for digital road network maps and will determine what legal measures will be required to protect the interests of data providers. 
PANDORA will liaise closely with other projects working on digital maps and road network databases.

17055;A 1019 (8206);EURODIABETA;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;MODELLING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR CHRONIC HEALTH CARE - EXAMPLE : DIABETES;;;;"EURODIABETA brought European experts together to perform a feasibility study on the production of a computer assisted chronic health care environment (CHCE) to support diabetes care as an example of all chronic disease care.
It is intended to go on to produce a functional specification of a CHCE and build a prototype system running in several European countries and dealing with more than one chronic disease.
EURODIABETA aims to set the standard for chronic health care in Europe. 3 main areas of the project contribute to standards: a European model of chronic health care, a European diabetic dataset and standards for the acceptance of information technology (IT) systems through evaluation and validation.

The main areas covered by the work were as follows:
process and data modelling;
investigations of the use of information technology in insulin therapy and diet therapy;
evaluation of knowledge based systems, human factors and socioeconomic awareness.
This proposal spans all three AIM Action Lines, because it considers in detail the needs of a typical area of chronic disease care : Diabetes. This involves work ranging from the very fundamental design level (developing a conceptual model of the process of health care), to generalisable decision support management systems (patient records, screening, diagnosis, referrals advice), to detailed prototypes with very specific applications (diet and insulin therapy). 
The critical factors on which the success of this project depend are as follows : 
a) availability of comprehensive and appropriate skills and expertise in relevant fields ; 
b) broad member state representation to achieve European consensus ; 
c) effective clinical co-operation with IT development across Europe ; 
d) previous successful relevant research ; 
e) feasibility of effectively integrating prototypes into patient care ; 
f) capacity for early exploitation of the product of collaboration. 
In order to achieve these aims, the consortium is drawn from seven European countries, with good representation from the relevant areas from each country (medical informatics, medicine, pharmaceutical and IT industry, bioengineering). This is deemed necessary to gain the sufficiently wide viewpoint essential to the development of a system for such a broad concept as chronic disease care which is generalisable across Europe at least.

The use of the prototype will be demonstrated by integrating it with various Action Line II components eg a Learner Expert System, an Authoring Facility, emerging from complementary DELTA projects. Thus ASAP plans to provide the basis of an open learning system platform for the DELTA programme. 
A prototype common platform has been developed and demonstrated which allows portability in training applications of a distance learning system.
A prototype was made available on 26/10/92
The ASAP prototype will incorporate the following characteristics: 
- it will be portable across a variety of hardware platforms both existing and future. In the first instance the prototyping will be carried out on a Sun Workstation and it will be ported onto a European platform consisting of the CHORUS distributed operating system and a suitable hardware platform. 
- it will provide support for high quality audio and visual interaction with emerging technologies including CD-ROM, Interactive Video, and voice I/0. 
- it will provide a sophisticated graphics environment based on the de-facto standard X-Windows system. 
- it will be built on top of an object system and will be supported from below by a sophisticated AI development environment. 
- it will incorporate a Hypermedia system for document preparation, user graphics and interaction with a colour PostScript compatible environment. 
- it will support object oriented interaction with databases. 

The ASAP architecture will support the evolution of a full Action Line II model, with the necessary communication hooks to Action Line III.

17061;A 1023 (8600);ADAM;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Advanced Architecture in Medicine;;;;"The ADAM project aims to develop information technology supports in the framework of General Practice. 
Two action lines have been depicted for the project : 
1. Set up of an Information Processing Environment supporting the medical activities of the General Practitioner (GP). 
2. Integration of the GP environment with the other services supplied by the Public Health Care Environment (hospitals, laboratories, etc). Integration is particularly important with respect to the exploitation of new activities such as preventative practice, epidemiological screening, etc. 
A workstation architecture has been designed for general practitioners to be integrated with the services supplied by national health care systems, in order to: 
decrease the gap between public health structures and citizens; 
organize and standardize general practice activities, increasing efficiency; 
give support for emerging aspects of general practice such as preventive medicine, epidemiological screening, research activity and education programmes. 

2 lines of action were pursued: 
setting up an information processing environment supporting the medical activities of the general practitioner (GP); 
The integration of the GP environment with the services supplied by other health care organizations at the information base level. 

The specification of the environment was carried out in 3 phases: 
the definition of a global data model representing the external interface and the data structures of the overall environment; 
the specification of 2 subsystems, 1 for either line of action described above; 
the development of a set of application tools for each subsystem. 

A data collection and analysis exercise was carried out which led to a functional structuring and rational grouping of GP activities and the definition of a reference model. The ANSA/ISA approach was then used to define the architecture for a GP workstation. The set of functions and architectural components was the starting point for the development of a prototype national GP workstation and a demonstrator. The project also explored the concepts and mechanisms associated with data security and privacy, concentrating on the legal and organizational aspects. The project has begun the classification of remote access to the services of health care centres and of the national health care system. The potential market for the workstation in Europe 13 approximately 400 000 systems. GPs total about 35% of all medical professionals in Europe.
The first phase of the project consists of the analysis of the real-life application domain in order to define the present scenario, the global requirement and the future trends. 
The second phase of the project deals with the definition of a global architecture of the ADAM environment. A generalized application development environment will be specified, giving standard criteria for the implementation of information processing applications in the General Practice area. 
A global conceptual model will be defined for the external interfaces and the data structures of the overall ADAM environment. 
The functional architecture will be specified decomposing the overall environment into three sub-systems, one for each of the above defined action lines. Then, a set of application development tools will be defined for each of the two sub-systems.

16953;V1016;INFOSAFE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;An Information System for Road User Safety;;;;"The objectives of this project are: 
- to define what information should be presented to the road users and when & how this should be done in order to ensure a maximum of understanding and adherence. 
- to specify technical requirements and an organisational framework to ensure that information reaches the road users.
The INFOSAFE project is concerned with the task of generating traffic safety related messages to all road users. The project will outline the structure of the rule bases necessary for handling detected incidents and generating appropriate messages. A prototype decision support system for the operator in traffic control centres is envisaged.
The INFOSAFE system will assist the operator in the traffic control centre by handling incoming information on the traffic situation, defining and structuring incidents, deciding relevant traffic engineering countermeasures, deciding actions to take for specific target groups and formulating messages for these target groups as a function of available means of communication. The system is designed to generate complex messages. Their presentation to the road user however, depends on which means of communication is chosen for transmitting the message (eg elaborate techniques in the vehicle for filtering and presenting the message to the driver allows for more complex messages than a variable road sign). The core of the INFOSAFE system will be the INFOSAFE database containing records of all incoming information and the actions being taken based on this information. The INFOSAFE system is planned for use in the traffic control centres of today and in centres with different geographical coverage. More elaborate detection techniques and developed decision support (eg simulation models and expert systems) can be added in the future.
The operating environment is as follows :
The system prototype will be developed for personal computer (PC) environments which facilitates wide spread use.
To achieve the objectives the project will specify a system for collecting, processing, transmitting and presenting traffic safety information to road users. To support this the project will produce: 
- an expert system which will generate understandable traffic safety related messages,  
- a manual for information definition supported by AI to facilitate the assessment of the severity of detected incidents, the response to be taken actions and the likely consequences of the incident, 
- recommendations for the organisation of traffic information including test software which can be adapted to differing national conditions.

17051;A1014 (8217);IRHIS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;An intelligent, adaptive information retrieval (IR) system as Hospital Information System (HIS) front end;;;;"Implementation of Hospital Information Systems (HIS)s at large hospitals is becoming more and more a routine. Initially restricted to accounting tasks, many of these systems are now capable to build and manage complete medical records. This new generation of HISs improves the control of clinical data flow and the quality of information but does not solve the problem of information overload. Medical records contain more information than any user can handle and the retrieval of information meaningful for patient care is still difficult and time consuming. Techniques to structure this information and help the health care practitioner navigate through the patient data, as well as the ability to abstract higher level information from the patient record would be useful adjuncts to HISs. It will allow rapid review of care of past and present medical history, surveillance of quality of care and will assist with clinical decision making. 
The goal of this project is to explore a solution to this problem of information overload in an effort to improve health-care delivery. This will be performed by studying techniques such as graphics, hypertext and artificial intelligence that assist the user to easily access on-line medical records and retrieve the information he needs for more reliable and more adequate patient care.
A project was initiated to explore a solution to the problem of information overload to improve health care delivery. This was performed by implementing a prototype demonstrator that assists the user to easily access on line medical records. The system is based on predefined user requirements and uses techniques such as graphics, hypertext and artificial intelligence. The project was carried out in three main phases: 
Design: Investigation was carried out in 3 countries to determine the information needs for representative groups of hospital information users. Requirements for developing intelligent and adaptive information retrieval (IR) systems were then defined and modelled. Implementation: A prototype information retrieval system was developed based on the requirements identified in the design phase. Evaluation: The prototype was evaluated from the point of view of developing generalized information retrieval systems. To define the kind of functionalities that must be added to a general IR system adapted to the needs of clinical practice, the user requirements in medical settings were studied. The definition of user requirements during the IRHIS project was a three step process: 
orientation phase with an overview of the potential users and their activities; 
definition of data grouping with respect to tasks; 
interview about users' information needs based on a well structured questionnaire. Software quality metrics were used to evaluate the success of the methods used in this project. The evaluation tool place whenever possible with the same users. A high level of users were satisfied with IRHIS. More precisely: 
the use of icons for the selection of the different parts of a patient record was well received; 
the overview of patient data in terms of substrates derived by the knowledge based system appears to be an original and highly appreciated feature; 
the presence of a medical consultant was greatly appreciated by the users. The on line availability of documentation about drugs, protocols and tests performed in the hospital corresponded to real needs.
Within the limited framework of the AIM pilot phase, we do not plan to study the hospital problem in its entirety but we will focus on the limited domain of Hemato-Oncology, and more particularly on the monitoring of patient undergoing chemotherapy protocols. 
The project consists of three main phases. In the first phase (Problem Definition and System Requirements), the information needs for indicative groups of hospital information users will be determined. Investigation in at least two countries will be carried out to determine which type of information is most relevant for each group of users and how this information is used and should be presented. Then, the requirements for developing intelligent and adaptive information retrieval systems will be determined and modeled. In the second phase (Implementation), a prototype information retrieval system will be developed based on the requirements identified in the design phase. Building the prototype, we will explore how graphics, hypertext and Artificial Intelligence (more particularly knowledge base systems) techniques can be used, and eventually combined, to allow more efficient access to a HIS. Finally, in the third phase (Evaluation), results will be evaluated from the point of view of deriving and modelling the requirements for developing generalized information retrieval systems.

17035;A1030 (8309);PACS IMACS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Operational Evaluation and Basic Requirements for Prospective Evolution of Pacs Technology;;;;"The aim of this project is to evaluate the results of the introduction of the PACS concept (Picture Archiving and Communication System) in the hospital environment and to guide its evolution towards an IMACS (Image Management and Communication System). A strong interaction and result exchange among the participants is expected due to the common technical area of interest and to the communication infrastructure under development in the context of a RACE project.

Nowadays PACS technology is available on the market and our first objective is to experiment and assess the currently available installations in the relevant pilot sites. 
A characterization study will be carried out to clearly identify users and needs. 
All the aspects related to the integration of PACS within the HIS (Hospital Information System) will be considered to allow a real data exchange with existing automated realities. 
Particular emphasis will be dedicated to diagnostic image presentation to verify its clinical validity and to define a common technical baseline, which will covers aspects such as communication speed and reliability, quality of the images, standards and organization. 
Further experimental activity on sophisticated technology will be performed to explore new diagnostic possibilities. 
Results and experiences gathered during the project will be used to set up a knowledge base to exchange and to rationally manage the technology. 
Manufacturers and users could profit of this knowledge for future development and applications.

17056;A 1016 (8517);ASSIST;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Assessment of Information Systems and Technologies in Medicine;;;;"The overall objective is to develop an assessment framework for information systems and technologies in medicine, which will facilitate decision-making at local, national and international levels. 
The key aspects of benefits and costs will be identified along with social, organizational and health service factors. 
Evaluation techniques have been developed to be used in the assessment of information technology applied in the health care sector. To provide the necessary background for developing the evaluation framework, surveys were undertaken into the current state of diffusion of information technology in European health care systems and the changes expected in the near future. The policies of European governments with regard to assessment of this type of technology were also reviewed. Widespread consultation with other projects has taken place to test the relevance of ideas and to disseminate results. 3 detailed case studies were developed to illustrate the use of the evaluation framework. 
4 objectives were identified for an integrated community approach to developing information technology: 
improved quality and service; 
improved cost effectiveness; 
improved biomedical research; 
improved industrial competitiveness. 

The European survey undertaken covered 16 countries from which 13 detailed responses were obtained. A comprehensive assessment approach was employed, and then narrowed down to the most important aspects. The approach covered constructive assessment during product development, technology assessment during field trials and later stages, and diffusion studies at any points. A list of elements were identified which were potentially relevant to an assessment: system costs, manpower implications and health benefits. It was concluded that a sound appraisal of any information technology development in health care should concentrate on these 3 areas. Controlled trials of decision support systems have been undertaken in order to measure the true health benefits. Proper controls in the evaluation of large systems are more difficult to achieve. Information technology offers the possibility to improve the quality and reduce the cost of studies.
The project will use the output of other AIM projects as a data source for the testing of criteria, and consult with other contractors on the feasibility of proposals through meetings and workshops. 
The project will draw in the benefits of outside experience and expertise through the members' extensive contacts with national and international organizations involved in technology assessment. 
During the AIM Exploratory Phase a recommended plan for the assessment of completed projects will be produced. 
The timing of the Exploratory Phase will prevent actual assessment of completed projects, but the proposed work will make a valuable contribution towards MT3 and the setting of future priorities.

16942;V1035;CHRISTIANE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Motorway Traffic Flow Monitoring and Control;;;;"The principal goal of this project is to define and build prototypes of systems for ramp metering control and variable traffic information on urban (linear and networked) motorways. Ramp metering distributes a given demand in space and time by influencing traffic volumes (traffic lights); message signs can be used to inform drivers and so divert them onto alternative routes to prevent or reduce congestion.
The existence of adequate macroscopic mathematical models for freeway traffic is a prerequisite for the development of traffic monitoring and efficient control strategies. 2 macroscopic traffic flow simulation models (SIMAUT and META) for linear motorway, one based on the kinematic wave theory and the second based on a state space framework, have been selected for improvement and comparative assessment on a linear motorway based on real data from 2 French sites and 1 British motorway.

Linear simulation was then extended to motorway networks with 2 simulation packages being developed. The network simulation program METANET was extended and improved to give simulation tool for broad use. METANET uses a macroscopic modelling approach to consider multiple origin, multiple destinations and network phenomena. The computational effort is low, hence the model can be used online for monitoring and control purposes. The development of a motorway network version of the well known simulation package CONTRAM, called MCONTRM, was completed with validation studies. MCONTRM is capable of calculating dynamic traffic assignment for use in route guidance. Moreover this tool is used within the aid to decision approach to motorway control.

2 approaches to motorway traffic control have been considered, aid to decision and fully automatic control strategies. The aid to decision approach is based on the use of an online traffic simulation model. It is implemented in the form of a knowledge based system and gives to the operator the opportunity to simulate the impact of the planned control actions on the traffic flow. The automatic approach is based on automatic control theory. The applied control law leads automatically to optimal decisions according to predefined criteria (eg queue length, travel time, etc).
The first step has been a review of different strategies used or tested for ramp metering both on an isolated and a coordinated level. A number of control strategies have been further improved and assessed in order to be implemented in the field. With concern to motorway network control, 2 entirely new control strategies (one based on automatic control concepts and another using aid to decision and expert system tools) have been developed and tested by simulation means for hypothetical scenaria and for existing motorway networks.

A number of field trials on motorway ramp metering have been designed, executed and evaluated at 2 different sites.
These field trials have been extremely useful for various reasons:
increasing confidence in the usefulness of ramp metering in general and in the effectiveness of particular control strategies;
more insight and understanding could be gained on the functioning of each control strategy and on the similarities and the differences between them;
a number of software prototypes have been produced;
a number of practical recommendations and generalised experience have been gained.

Twenty subjects were provided with in car route guidance equipment, and then drove between a preselected set of origins and destinations in Athens, both with and without the benefit of the route guidance. Most of the participants had no substantial predisposition for or against route guidance. They expected that it would be useful to them when driving in unfamiliar areas, but not in familiar areas, unless it provided real dynamic information on traffic conditions. Oral information was preferred to visual information, though some participants preferred a combination of both.
The research focuses on two points: 
- Motorway traffic flow modelling. 
Existing models will be improved and adapted to real-life conditions and extended to cover motorway networks. 
- Motorway traffic flow management and control. 
Two approaches will be investigated - advisory and fully automatic control strategies. Advisory systems allow the operator to simulate some strategies and to choose the `best' according to human experience. Automatic control strategies, based on the theory of optimal control, lead to optimal decisions according to pre-defined criteria (e.g. queue length, travel time etc.). 
This theoretical and experimental investigation will include implementation considerations such as alternative measurement and control devices, computer hardware facilities, communication media, system architecture, and man-machine interfaces. Special attention will be paid to system flexibility with respect to the future development of a route guidance facility. 
Prototypes both for local and coordinated control will be created. `Real life' experiments for both types of on-ramp metering will be performed at selected sites.

16925;V1045;PARCMAN;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Parking Management, Control and Information Systems;;;;"The aim of this project is to develop an efficient set of centralised parking management, control and information systems. These will require the development of complex systems which should function in co-ordination with the overall system developed for integrated traffic demand management.
The research had the following objectives:
reduction of travel and parking search times;
optimisation of the distribution of parking supply;
decongestion of the traffic network by minimising traffic generated by drivers in search of parking space;
optimisation of modal split policies through adequate use of parking policies;
reduction of monetary, operational and social costs.

Achievements attained so far fall mainly in 4 areas:
the assessment of existing parking control and information systems and the parking policy issues within an road Transport informatics (RTI) environment as well as methods of enforcement;
the identification of various modelling requirements and components for the PARCMAN system;
the development of a working modelling prototype for effective parking management and control;
technical issues of specifying the information system and the information networks.
Based on the premise that the resulting parking management strategies should contribute to a trend-setting, long-standing policy amenable to effective enforcement, the study will specify and test a number of strategies on the basis of simulated demand/supply schemes. The results of these tests will be evaluated through simulation and a set of possible or best strategies will be stored on a 'library' together with their corresponding demand/supply schemes. 
Real-time parking control will then be simulated and tested in a laboratory controlled experiment. The control process will be based on the reception of on-line traffic and parking availability data which will be processed by a pattern recognition algorithm and the proper strategy will be selected from the library. 
The project will devise appropriate methodologies to manage the dissemination and distribution of information and will adopt an open architecture in order to allow later incorporation of emerging technologies. A demonstration programme will be set up to test various control strategies and assess the communication infrastructure needs for the management of the flow of information.

17034;A1002 (8305);OAR;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Specification for an Open Architecture for Reasoning;;;;"The main goals of this project are : 
1. to specify an open architecture for reasoning and 
2. to construct a prototype query generator for literature retrieval. 
The term 'open' means a system in which the knowledge representation schemata are explicitly defined, and open to user alteration. Similar requirements hold true for the reasoning procedures. An additional requirement is that there are powerful general reasoning primitives to construct the high level queries. 
The relation oriented inference system (ROIS) is a knowledge based system (KBS) which makes possible the construction of decision support systems tailored to specific applications. This KBS comprises 3 layers; a basic low level inference engine, a subshell and the knowledge base. The function of the subshell is to provide, on the one hand, a data model for representing (scientific) knowledge and, on the other hand, a high level reasoning model. The significance of the subshell is that reasoning algorithms can be separated from the knowledge representation. As the structure for knowledge representation and the reasoning mechanisms are explicitly defined in the knowledge base, a very open and flexible system is fixed. Using this structure it is possible to define several reasoning strategies and a consequence of the system design is that the expert can build the knowledge base independently.
 The system has the following characteristics:
 there are self definable reasoning strategies;
 there is no need for a knowledge engineer;
 there is an effective reduction of search space.
As a means to arrive at a set of requirements for the system specifications, the project will investigate a small scale application using an available tool called MEDES. This application is concerned with making a meaningful connection between patient records and literature. It is felt by the partners that the requirements for such an application together with the existing tool concepts cover many of the demands for a general system. One of the partners, Elsevier, will provide the information and facilities to connect the patient and literature systems syntactically as well as semantically. The outcome is expected to have a great impact on future literature retrieval tools. 
MEDES, the results of the implementation, and the experience of the partners will be input to the specification for a system to build in the main phase of AIM. 
MEDES is a general tool for representing various types of (deep) knowlege . MEDES supports a representation that emphasizes several types of binary relations and a reasoning language that specifies operations on those relations. Prototype knowledge bases for different ways of exploiting medical KBS have been constructed within MEDES. 
This project will explore the extension of MEDES to handle patient records and medical literature - call these medical documents. The types of relations and reasoning which are needed to support storage and retrieval of medical documents will be investigated. Evaluations will be done with real medical knowledge, real patient records, and real medical literature. Within the time-frame of this project, a rapid small-scale implementation in MEDES will be done so as to facilitate verification to the robustness of the extensions.

16958;V1011;CARGOES;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Integration of Dynamic Route Guidance and Traffic Control System;;;;"Infrastructure based dynamic route guidance systems will provide valuable information for the traffic control authorities and in turn information from traffic control systems will be required by the guidance system in order that its routing advice is appropriate. This project's goal is the integration of the dynamic route guidance and traffic control systems (TCS).
The project CAR-GOES, for the past 3 years, has been investigating the integration of infrastructure-based dynamic route guidance (DRG) systems with existing forms of urban traffic control (UTC). The performance of different levels of integration have been studied, principally by simulation, for various types of dynamic route guidance, ranging from centralized to distributed (but excluding systems where route optimisation is performed in the vehicle), as well as various types of urban traffic control, ranging from fixed time to traffic responsive. Some attention has been given to multirouteing, which would be required with increasing rates of market penetration. The prediction of link travel times has been looked at, and the need for dynamic assignment coupled with the estimation of origin destination flows, particularly under high market penetration scenarios, has been pointed to.
Research within CAR-GOES has led to recommendations and designs for integrating centralised and decentralised DRG systems with a range of UTC systems used throughout Europe, and has illustrated the benefits which can be obtained. A range of strategies have been formulated for various levels of integration, based primarily on existing forms of UTC but allowing for new forms of DRG. The performance of some strategies have been studied by simulation for various levels of penetration.
A prototype was made available on 25/08/92
The work is split into four work areas: 
A. deals with the state-of-the-art in TCS and route guidance systems with a view to the new data exchange requirement. It includes an analysis of established TCS and DRG (Dynamic Route Guidance) by all partners. On the basis of this Work Area A creates the framework for the rest of the project. Input from various other DRIVE Tasks will be required, e.g. advanced parking control, road pricing systems. 
B. concerns strategies for dynamic guidance and driver information systems and route optimization techniques. It will specify, develop and simulate strategies and algorithms appropriate for an integrated TCS & DRG environment. 
C. will establish specifications for a common roadside infrastructure based integrated guidance and traffic control system. The work will include: 
- a review of the existing systems to establish the starting situation; 
- an investigation of the requirements of the various actors and user groups to determine functional requirements and constraints; 
- a recommended system design and specifications for implementation. 
D. covers the implementation aspects and recommendations for a series of field trials.

Also, an inventory of telecommunication services and related standard protocols, relevant to flexible and open learning, has been produced.
Starting from the definition of a model of architecture of a Learning System, from the functional requirements at the different actors' point of view in terms of exchange of information, and from a critical evaluation of the existing relevant standards, the Least project will define : 

- a set of relevant existing standards with regards to the learning requirements, 
- proposals for standards in the areas where they are missing, 
- recommendations for the definition of Learning System profiles with the possible associated standards.";;;;;SOCIETE ETUDES SYSTEMS AUTOMATIONS (SESA);FR;"Bull SA;Centre Commun d'Études de Télécommunications et de Télédiffusion (CCETT);MARI ADVANCED MICROELECTRONICS LTD;DDTEC;CLEO;UNIVERSITY OF LIÈGE;EUROFORMATIQUE;UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);COURSEWARE EUROPE";"FR;UK;BE;NL";
17036;A 1024 (8804);QUIRT;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Real Time Imaging and Quality Control in Radiation Therapy;;;;"The major goal of the QUIRT project was the design and implementation of a system for the improvement of the treatment accuracy in radiotherapy in 4 European cancer institutions. This objective was pursued by the further development of an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) and the design of software for the detection of patient set up errors. This software was extensively tested in clinical practice.
In addition, a prototype online areal dosimeter was derived from the EPID, based on the same principle and using the same microcomputer system and software as required for the EPID. The EPID and the automatic and interactive image analysis software modules proved to be reliable and fast tools for the online verification of a number of treatment set ups. The EPID is being commercialized and with further development of optimum image processing techniques, the QUIRT system is expected to successfully replace conventional films for portal imaging and to provide online error detection. The implementation of QUIRT systems in radiotherapy centres will greatly improve the reliability of the results of randomized clinical studies and allow the use of more complex treatment techniques.
The project can be divided into four interconnected parts : 
I. Designing software for the detection of patient set-up errors 
 Anatomical landmarks in a simulator ('intended') image and in a portal ('actual') image of a patient treatment with the recently developed real time image detector, can be used to determine patient set-up errors, e.g. radiation field edge deviations. Due to the specific problems of patient imaging during radiotherapy, e.g.the poor visibility of anatomical structures in the portal image, special software has to be developed to find these anatomical landmarks automatically. A next problem is to quantify the errors using the detected landmarks. This requires the development of sophisticated image processing and pattern recognition software. 
II. Development of an on-line areal dosimeter 
 The principle of the real time image detector for radiotherapy set-up verification can also be used for the accurate quantification of the applied dose. First, the detector has to be modified to give it characteristics necessary for an accurate dosimetry system. Furthermore, the system has to be tested in the clinic, to relate the dose at the position of the detector to that in the irradiated patient. Four detectors will be constructed and installed in radiotherapy centres in four different European countries. 
III. Real time imaging and on-line dosimetry in clinical practice 
 Real time image detectors will be installed in the same four radiotherapy centres, to detect patient set-up errors. The trials, will be collected and transported to a central institute. In addition, other individual patient data, such as treatment plans and data obtained with the on-line dosimeters, will be collected and transmitted. 
IV. Quality control network for individual patient data acquisition 
 After designing the network and installation of network apparatus in the four participating centres, individual patient data have to be transmitted from these centres to a central office. These data concern images from the real time imaging device, digitized simulator images, data from the on-line areal dosimeter and data concerning the treatment planning. 
Main Deliverables : 
Data on the performance of the imaging device. A real on-line dosimeter for measuring patient exit dose. Various software modules.";;;;;THE NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE;NL;"Radiological Institute;CENTRE GF LECLERC;ST. RAFAEL'S KLINIK;Varian T E M Ltd";"IT;FR;BE;UK";
17265;P7065/D1025;PRECISE;;FP2-DELTA 1;;FP2;Promoting and Realising ELTA through Communication and Information Strategies for Europe;;;;"The PRECISE study has resulted in the organization of a conference with 330 participants, 2 main seminars and 9 concertation meetings covering the areas of flexible and distance learning.
 The main theme of the original proposal by 7065 is 'Information Integration'. From the Recommendations of the Evaluation Panel it becomes clear that this theme is still important: 'They (7065) should be viewed as the information stimulation, harmonisation and gathering agency .....'. However, the actual dissemination of information will be the responsibility of another consortium (INTERMAPS). In the set up of Action Line I, three consortia will be responsible for the work packages defined. Together with consortium START-UP, 7065 has responsibility for Information Resources in the DELTA Exploratory Action. In addition to this and the above mentioned responsibility for information integration, the PRECISE- consortium has a main task in organising and stimulating ELTA (European Learning Technology Association). The establishment of ELTA as an Association which can and will be active after the completion of the DELTA Exploratory Action deserves special attention. There are already many associations and councils in Europe, but none of them has a scope broad enough to fulfill the needs of a general European platform for all actors involved in learning technology. One of the ways to accomplish this crucial task is in making 'ELTA' visible, by organising seminars, publishing newsletters, organising a conference, offering services to members. 

The consortium will contribute to the objectives with the following deliverables: 
- the first DELTA conference; 
- seminars in the framework of ELTA and DELTA Exploratory Action; 
- ELTA as a continuing Association, linked with existing associations (including national programmes) in and outside the DELTA-Community; 
- promotion and support ELTA; 
- strategies for information harmonisation and standardisation; 
- strategies for information integration; monitoring of the actual results in the DELTA Exploratory Action from this point of view; 
- reports on state-of-the-art in several simulation areas; 
- reports on case studies and pilot-studies; 
- information and input for INTERMAPS; 
- newsletter data; 
- participation in editorial boards.";;;;;EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING CONSORTIUM BV;NL;"Philips;AEG Olympia Office GmbH;UNIV. TWENTE;Fundesco;EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING CONSORTIUM BV;Open University;Macmillan Intek;EUROPE (PRECISE);Ernst Klett Verlag für Wissen und Bildung GmbH";"NL;DE;ES;UK";
16944;V1027;EUROFRET;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;A European System for International Road Freight Transportation Operations;;;;"The main goal of this project is to set out the functional characteristics of an RTI based pan-European system of road freight operation in order to optimize efficiency, economic and other types of performance. To achieve this requires the development of strategies that would allow integrated freight and commercial fleet management, order processing and improved communication between the various actors involved in the European road freight. 
The major objectives of the project the are to: 
- define the scope and principal characteristics of a pan-European road freight operation system, 
- investigate the feasibility of developing the above system, 
- develop alternative strategies for the system's operation, based on informatics technology, 
- specify the systems critical functions, 
- evaluate all the options and alternative systems.
The research has investigated the possibility of setting strategies at government level for road transport informatics (RTI) applications in road freight operations (RFO). Alternative scenario were devised for the development of RFO operations over the next 20 years in Europe. For each scenario the most important RFO activities were identified. The possibility of serving these scenario specific activities by various RTI technologies was subsequently evaluated and relevant strategies developed.

The strategies were evaluated with respect to the applicability using criteria such as acceptability by users, costs and benefits, timing of applications, geographical differentiation of applications, etc. Subsequently, one strategy was selected by European wide application in the short and medium term which corresponded to a set of RTI activities serving specific RFO functions. The evolution of this RTI strategy in RFO was also studied taking into account its impacts on RFO and the expected problems in the dissemination of RTI applications. The role of market force as well as that of governments was carefully studied in this context.

Finally the possibility of a system architecture, was evaluated. It was concluded that, at present, an integrated road transport environment (IRTE) is not possible because of technical, political, economical and social constraints in different European countries. A system of 4-pre-IRTE's is suggested as the most preferable step towards that direction.

Road transport informatics (RTI) technologies are developed by industry but promoted both by industry and government (EEC, national governments). This research has investigated the possibility of setting strategies at government level for RTI applications in road freight operations (RFO). To achieve this, first alternative scenaria were devised for the development of RFO operations over the next 20 years in Europe. For each scenario the most important RFO activities were identified. The possibility of serving these scenario specific activities by various RTI technologies was subsequently evaluated and relevant strategies developed. Governments' stand against these strategies can be moderated through the application of various means and policies which constitute a different approach to strategy development for promoting technology innovation in RFO. These strategies were evaluated with respect to their applicability using criteria such as acceptability by users, costs and benefits, timing of applications, geographical differentiation of applications, etc. The research resulted in a proposed preferred strategy for the use of RTI in RFO throughout Europe.
Planned work includes: 
- a structural phase (literature review, overall project definition), 
- interviews with various 'agents' or 'actors', seeking opinions and case studies, 
- analysis and evaluation of alternative strategies. 
- alternative organisational structures and exploitation of RTI technology.

17048;A1007 (8107);HOME;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Highly Optimized Microscope Environment;;;;"Design of hardware and software interfacing between pathologists/microscopes/laboratory and computer network, taking into account a functional model of medical practice and laboratory activity in cyto- and histopathology.
Axial strain controlled low cycle fatigue tests were carried out on type 316 stainless steel parent metal, vacuum and nonvacuum electron beam welds, submerged arc welds and gas shielded metal arc welds. Testing covered total strains in the range 0.6% to 2%, and was at room temperature and 550 C. Parent metal and the electron beam welds showed rapid cyclic hardening, while arc welds showed little hardening. The weld metal cyclic stress strain response was above that obtained for the parent metal, although below data obtained by other workers for similar parent materials. Weld metal endurances were above the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) N47 continuous cycling design line at both temperatures, and comparable with parent metal data. However, the weld metal data approached the design line at low strain ranges (around 0.5%). Endurances were predicated from crack growth rates estimated from striation spacings, giving acceptable results except for the gas shielded metal arc weldments.

Since the HOME project is a hardware and software combination, its use in the health care system is dependent on the commercial availability of the HOME microscope workstation. The HOME prototype has already implemented software for daily routine work as screening for cancer and reviewing the work done by the cytotechnicians. These low level and medium level functions seem already sufficient to justify the acquisition of the microscope workstation by a pathology laboratory.

Before full exploitation, 5 prototypes need to be built and distributed for daily use to 5 important European pathology laboratories. This first field trial will be a comparison between quality in cancer screening with or without the HOME interface. It must run for about 2 years to be conclusive. These results will be also evaluated in terms of time and cost effectiveness.

Since the HOME microscope workstation will be commercially available before the end of the field trials, a HOME users group will be managed by the project in order to collect valuable feedback. This feedback is necessary to figure out all the possible medical applications of the HOME workstation in addition to those already considered of prime importance by the consortium and presently implemented as dedicated software modules.

Owing to the commitment of Zeiss and Alcatel TITN, far beyond the framework of the subcontract, it has been possible to built an industrial prototype of the HOME workstation in addition to the laboratory prototype.

It is one of the outcomes of the HOME project as well as a new general trend, that interactive image analysis is needed by the pathologists to reach the objectivity, reproducibility and quantification necessary for an overall improvement of cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow up. Since the HOME partners have an acknowledged competence in the field of quantitative image analysis in biology and medicine, both the industrial partners and the research laboratories are optimistic about the possibility to use the HOME interface for this purpose of interactivity.
HOME hardware research and development programme 
This part of the project consists in introducing the computer display in the optical pathways of the microscope. This display can be a high quality small-sized camescope. The introduction of the camescope in the microscope can be done using the existing pathways which already serves to project various frames and numerical indications for photography at the microscope. Such built-in pathways can be adapted to conventional routine microscopes by inserting a 'camera lucida' optical device between the objective holder and the eye pieces. Most of the manufacturers already have such an optional optical system. Because of the optical peculiarities of each microscope brand, the geometry as well as the displaying mode of the camescope have to be specifically designed. For example, the intensity of the camescope screen can be adapted by automatic feedback on the basis of the signal detected by the video-camera used as the detector for image processing and analysis. 
HOME software research and development programme 
This part of the project will address the following topics : 
- Analyze in detail the way the pathologists work presently on conventional microscopes in clinical routine. 
- Analyze in detail the improvements actually needed for image analysis and cell featuring compatible with the conventional observation mode. 
- Determine the ergonomic requirements of the computer mouse when its location is projected into the microscope field ; is that man-machine interfacing efficient for cytometry and histometry ? 
- What are the practical consequences of the use of expert systems in microscope imaging ; is it compatible with the HOME concept ? 
From such studies, two main developments will emerge : One is the microscope interfacing in the pathology laboratory local network, and the other is the integration of already existing microscope image analysis systems for improved medical diagnosis and prognosis.

17275;P7126/D1007;TOSKA;;FP2-DELTA 1;;FP2;Tools and Methods for a Sophisticated Knowledge-Based Content Free Authoring Facility;;;;"The proposed project deals with the concept definition of a multi-purpose, knowledge-based authoring environment for the production support of distance learning courses. In the centre of investigation will be the concept of a `Universal Teaching Engine' that is able to support the authoring process under varying constraints established through different contents domains, learner requirements, and even technical up- and downgrade according to the peripheral devices available in a specific environment. 
A tool has been produced for the specification of a wide range of instructional strategies which facilitates rapid prototyping. Also, a tool has been developed for the implementation of learner modelling techniques covering static learner attributes.
The project aims at the development of a demonstrable prototype that is initially validated and able to show the full functionality of the system as an authoring support tool. 

As a knowledge-based system the proposed authoring tool will make use of various kinds of knowledge about contents-independent conditions of teaching and learning. This includes features of i) how to structure the instructional contents in terms of goal hierarchies; ii) how to teach in terms of tutorial, presentation and management strategies; iii) how to model the learner in order to adapt the instructional system reactions to specific cognitive and motivational prerequisites and individual learning strategies.

16962;V1015;CLAIRE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Artificial Intelligence Based Systems for Traffic Control;;;;"The overall objective is to develop a Knowledge Base System (KBS) for traffic control. The project will focus on the study of urban traffic control techniques (fixed and real-time).
The overall objective of the project is to delineatetechniques for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to traffic control problems through the development of an expert system, in order to overcome many shortcomings of existing operator controlled systems. Traffic control practices were reviewed to give an informed base from which standard parameters and indicators for traffic control were defined. To cope with the real time demands of the problem, intelligent data processing and performance monitoring software was developed. The core of the expert system, the knowledge base, was developed to provide strategies for congestion and traffic control. Work on specifying standard interfaces between the expert system and traffic control systems was also undertaken. The expert system has been developed and tested using offline modelling techniques, finally resulting in the CLAIRE expert system prototype.
Aa industrial product was made available on 09/01/92

The research aimed at identifying the functions and components of a prototype expert system. Studies to identify differences in signal control parameter definition and urban traffic policy of European Cities were carried out. Identifying the differences was fundamental to ensuring that the system was compatible with, and would operate independently of, current urban traffic control systems. Through studies of congestion monitoring and measures of performance, methods to diagnose and evaluate congestion tress, were derived. The offline modelling capability of the system was used to define remedial control strategies for congestion and was based on signal optimization and route assignment.

The prototype expert system developed has the following functions:
it performs congestion management independently of the type of urban traffic control systemsimplemented;
through a flexible programming facility, it can meet the constraints of the various control philosophies exercise by different traffic authorities (ie, area policy, green wave, etc);
it has intelligent online monitoring capability to build up a historic picture of events;
it is capable of recognizing congestion patterns building up in a network;
it uses diagnostic methods online to interpret the different congestion problems and selects a remedial control strategy from a library of such plans;
relies on offline modelling to derive the library of remedial plans.

The system has been used to process congestion information from the demand responsive control system using a link with Leicestershire County Council's Traffic Management Computer. The preliminary assessment of the system is encouraging.
It is expected that the KBS will be compatible with most of existing UTC in Europe. The project will lead to proposals for demonstrations in several European cities. 
Sub-objectives for the KBS are as follows: 
- to review traffic control practices; 
- to define standard parameters and indicators for traffic control; 
- to develop intelligent data processing and performance monitoring software; 
- to develop a knowledge base on congestion and traffic control strategies; 
- to specify a standard for the interface between the KBS and UTC; 
- to specify, design and develop to Export System prototype (database, test of inference engine, interfaces,...); 
- to develop off-line modelling capability and traffic signal optimization for the command.

16963;V1006;DRIVAGE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Factors in Elderly People's Driving Abilities;;;;"The main objectives of this research were to investigate the capabilities, attitudes, performance and problems of older drivers and to establish a methodology for the evaluation of road transport information science innovations (RTI) among older drivers.
Considerable research has already been undertaken by cognitive psychologists and traffic scientists on the performance of older drivers on specific, and often abstract, driver tasks. This project builds from existing knowledge and investigates driver performance in more complex situations.
Driver performance of elderly people is being assessed using laboratory simulation and tests as well as in depth interviews and focused group discussions. The evaluation of RTI systems among elderly drivers is being done by monitoring elderly drivers' responses to RTI innovations.
The project is primarily concerned with safety objectives. Driving is a complex task that requires the integration of several levels of mental action. Strategic decisions affect the timing and zonal routing of journeys. Tactical decisions influence the speed, local routing, degree of compliance with traffic regulations, choice of grade of road and other characteristics of the journey. At the operational level, the driver reacts to road and weather conditions, the behaviour of other vehicles, and his or her own mental state, especially with regard to fatigue, impatience, danger and haste.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

The research has brought together information scientist, cognitive psychologists and social gerontologists to investigate the driving abilities, attitudes and problems of elderly people and the scope of new road transport informatics (RTI) devices for helping them become safer and more confident drivers. The methodology involved the development of experimental tasks on 2 simulators, one a computer based divided attention task developed by the Traffic Research Centre at the University of Groningen, the other an interactive video based set up developed by the Division of Engineering at King's College London. The experimental designs based on these simulators have been integrated with questionnaire based studies of driver histories and characteristics. The questionnaire has been deployed in both countries and to the simulator trial subjects. Preliminary results show that elderly drivers performance on RTI related tasks was significantly impaired.
The project comprises two main activities: 
1. Review of the specific needs and problems of elderly drivers. Panels of elderly road users in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will be set up to provide information on the behavioural patterns and traffic circumstances leading to accidents and altered car usage. The conceptual and perceptive functioning of the subjects will be assessed by in-depth interviews. Objective data will also be collected by laboratory observations of driving behaviour. The integration of the insights of behavioural, information science and in-depth interview evidence will increase understanding of driver errors and accidents, and point towards driver-training and testing programmes. Recommendations will also be made concerning product development and RTI innovations. 
2. Testing of proposed RTI improvements for elderly driver. RTI improvements will be tested on a panel of elderly people through a flexible combination of laboratory and in-depth interview approaches. Drivers of different age-groups, sex and urban-rural residence will be examined with the objective of describing the differences in the effects of new RTI systems on different age groups. As a result design modifications may be recommended.

16956;V1019;CASSIOPE;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Computer Aided System for Scheduling Information and Operation of Public Transport in Europe;;;;"This project will (i) identify the needs of public transport for RTI systems, (ii) develop European standards in the field of scheduling, information, control and management, and (iii) design a modular system which incorporates these standards, RTI developments of other sectors and ESPRIT programme results.
A pan-European architecture for computer aided systems and applications in the field of public transport (PT) has been defined, including scheduling, user information, fare collection, etc.
The work has covered 4 main areas:
identification of the main operator needs (survey of 119 European companies in 1989) and definition of common functional specifications (CFS);
building of reference data models and databases for PT information systems and software applications;
realisation of demonstration projects (scheduling and passenger information), showing the feasibility of the Cassiope architecture in real situations and providing feedback for possible generalisation;
dissemination of the project results, in order to promote the Cassiope architecture.

Studies mainly concentrated on offline functions such as scheduling, passenger information, fare collection, maintenance, strategic planning, management information and operations management. Systems have been successfully developed and tested (a scheduling demonstration and an interactive information terminal) to show the overall feasibility of the Cassiope architecture and to provide experience in the problems to be overcome in the design of public transport data models, databases and interfaces.
The main outputs will be to lay down specifications for such an overall system ('CASSIOPE') or for selected modules within it, and to evaluate a demonstration project. A macro economic model will be used to evaluate the probable benefits of RTI for road transport operators so that an optimal strategy can be recommended for Europe. Experience gained from various existing European systems will form the basis for the development of a second generation approach. Second generation systems will be better suited to network and user needs, modular, have the possibility of staged implementation (Ie the development of interfaces between components which allow future inclusion of new functions), use appropriate standards and achieve a technological breakthrough by means of the use of new technologies. 
After an initial study of users requirements and existing strategies, the project will: 
- Define the functionalities of the system.  
- Design a prototype of the CASSIOPE system. 
- Implement and evaluate a demonstration project. This demonstration project will also include results from the DRIVE Project V1001.

17047;A1008 (8409);HIPACS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Hospital Integrated Picture Archiving and Communication System;;;;"In the hospital of the future, diagnostic imaging procedures based on picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), are expected to replace the film-based procedures of today. This will require a tight integration of PACS with the other hospital structures. The current state of technology only allows the realization of partial, small-scale solutions in the clinical environment. 
The aim of this project is therefore the identification and - whenever possible - elimination of the bottlenecks that hamper the implementation of a full scale hospital integrated PACS.
Research has been carried out on the development of second generation picture archiving and communication systems, to be integrated with hospital information systems. The enormous amounts of data to be transported put specific requirements on network management, and made distributed databases essential. 6 main technical problems have been addressed: 
the modelling of the system and coupling with the hospital information system, patient management procedures and radiology information system; 
high speed image networking based on the use of optical fibre; 
knowledge based network management techniques; 
multimedia database techniques with facilities for intelligent retrieval of information and related services; 
an adaptive user interface for increased diagnostic efficiency; 
standardization. 

A hierarchical layered storage structure was proposed for the memory, prefetching being a prerequisite for an acceptable response time. Traffic management was studied extensively. The characteristics exhibited by the final concept were: 
the system medically driven and suits the needs of different groups of users, through an adaptive user interface; 
there are options for modular architecture (specialized small systems, integrated as a logical whole within a distributed network); 
open architecture multivendor environment using recognized standards. Distributed data base and/or local store with prefetching and preloading capability; 
integration with the radiological and/or hospital information system, inclusive provision for prefetching and preloading strategies; 
knowledge based networking allowing an intelligent distribution of the image within a distributed network.
In order to achieve this goal, coordinated research efforts in the fields of digital network design, data management software and diagnostic imaging workstations are needed. Our approach will channel these efforts into 5 main tasks : 
1. The modelling of the PACS/HIS and also the related coupling of PACS and HIS will primary, deliver tools for the development of management software. 
2. A model of heterogeneous network structure will be developed and used to study routing optimization of image and other data in existing and future networks. 
3. A prototype of high-speed network for image transfer will be implemented and evaluated. 
4. Multi-media data base software with facilities for intelligent information retrieval will be developed. 
5. An adaptive user-interface for increased diagnostic efficiency of existing image workstations will be designed.

1. To develop a Software Quality Assurance 'Process' Standard in draft form suitable for submission to ISO/CEN-CENELEC procedures in a complimentary form to ISO9001 series. 
In addition we aim : 
2. To make a Needs Analysis & Planning Study for a Software Quality 'Product' Standard. 
3. To provide AIM Programme staff with a comprehensive survey on relevant software standardization and certification practices in Europe and internationally to assist in AIM Programme planning. 
Research was commissioned to develop a software quality assurance process standard, suitable for submission to ISO/CEN-CENELEC procedures in a complementary form to the ISO 9001 series, with a major subsidiary objective to make a needs analysis and planning study for a software quality product standard. The incentives identifying the need for the project were general current software quality problems, which may be summarized as: 
increasing criticality of information technology (IT) products for users; 
management concern to control IT and its costs; 
European government/industry actions to promote new quality standards. The principal work packages produced by the project have been: 
an analysis of current and new software quality standards, together with a brief review of other relevant standards; 
the key view on software quality assurance of the healthcare community and its suppliers which led to the major finding that there is little awareness of the meaning of software quality or of the impact of quality standards amongst the healthcare community, so that it lags behind such sectors as defence and aerospace by 10 years; 
a draft process healthcare software quality assurance standard, in 2 parts which provide the rationale for the standard, based on software safety considerations, and the standard itself, which is intended for use in strict correspondence with ISO 9000-3; 
a needs analysis and planning study for a product healthcare software quality assurance standard.
The MASQUES project will conduct the main part of the project in an accelerated form the customary standards development process using : 
- Integrated user/supplier and other key viewpoints inputs ; 
- Intensive Workshops based approach ; 
- Information technology to the maximum. 
We thus combine best expert input supplied by Information Technology itself, and draw upon latest ESPRIT and other relevant research and standards development. 
A special feature of the MASQUES is the establishment of a HOSPITALS & CLINICS Club to assist in determining the requirements of the key users - the Doctors, and also to assist in disseminating the results.

17033;A1003 (8218);NLPAD;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Natural Language processing of PAtient Discharge summaries;;;;"The dramatic expansion of health services over the past several decades has created a growing demand for fast and easy access to relevant data. For a number of applications, such a ongoing patient care, evaluation of health care, and clinical research, the most important information about the patient medical history is mainly available in narrative patient discharge summaries (PDS). The overall goal of this project is to provide better access to this information through the development of a natural language (NL) processing system applying medical knowledge to perform two kinds of services : 
a) intelligent automatic extraction of the data from the PDS in order to store them in an appropriate database and  
b) intelligent NL retrieval of medical data from that database, thus allowing user to access quickly and easily the information. 
A project was created to provide better access to information about the patient medical history contained in a narrative patient discharge summary (PDS), through the development of a natural language (NL) processing system applying medical knowledge to perform two kinds of services: 
intelligent automatic extraction of the data from the PDS in order to store them in an appropriate database (extraction prototype); 
intelligent NL retrieval of medical data from that database. The extraction is considered here. The feasibility of this was evaluated by designing and testing a small prototype performing information extraction from PDSs in a restricted medical domain: therapy management of thyroid chancer. A preliminary study was carried out. Physicians' information needs were studied. A lexical study was carried out to measure the size of the vocabulary involved. The syntactic characteristics revealed in the PDS were also studied. The next step was in a computer format to identify and describe the various types of domain models needed by the text understanding system. A knowledge representation formalism was set up which described knowledge as well as a semantic lexicon for the test domain. At the lexical level, each word was described in terms of a set of semantic components. A situational model of the information conveyed by the PDS sentence has been built. For testing purposes, a simple natural language generation program has been connected to the conceptual extraction module. The syntactic and conceptual modules were finally integrated into a unique extraction prototype, and this prototype was tested on a selected corpus of typical PDS sentences. These tests showed that the prototype extraction system obtained a fair rating according to the size of its knowledge base.
The proposal rests under several hypotheses to be evaluated in the pilot phase of AIM : 
- Intelligent, knowledge based, NL processing can solve medical information needs ; 
- NL technology has now reached a point where it can be applied to the medical domain with serious chances of success ; 
- both extraction of information from narrative PDS and subsequent NL retrieval of information require an extensive knowledge base of the medical domain covered by the system ; 
- the same kind of knowledge can be used both for extraction and retrieval, thus requesting only one knowledge base for both components of the system. 
The Exploratory Phase will evaluate these hypotheses by designing and testing a small prototype performing both information extraction from PDS and processing of NL requests in a selected medical specialty. One important characteristic is that we shall make use, both for information extraction and information retrieval, of existing prototypes of NL processing systems, a fact which will allow us to test quickly important hypotheses without excessive implementation work. As application domain, we chose therapy management of thyroid cancer, a domain where knowledge is well defined and is almost independent of other medical domains, thus enabling us to work in a 'close world', and thus to test more easily methods that make extensive use of domain knowledge. The results of the pilot phase will include feasibility conclusions on the prototyping experiments and on the porting of the system to other medical domains. 
Main Deliverables : 
Prototype of an automatic system for the extraction of information from PDS and a prototype of an information retrieval system using natural language. The project will also produce reports on knowledge and information needs.";;;;;BIM S.A./N.V.;BE;Service d'Informatique Médicale de l'Assistance Publique;FR;
16940;V1033;AUTOPOLIS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Automatic Policing Information Systems;;;;"The general objective of this project is to determine the technical potential of, and requirements for, automatic policing systems that will be able to warn the driver that they are about to commit an offence and/or will record details of offences that do occur.
Available methodologies of traffic law enforcement are less than adequate to control driver behaviour at present, and will be unable to cope with the demand for traffic law enforcement posed by the introduction of road traffic informatics (RTI) and increasing traffic volumes. Work has been carried out to determine the possibilities of, and the requirements for, implementing automatic policing information systems that can detect a limited number of safety relevant traffic violations, provide feedback to the driver when he is committing a traffic offence, and register traffic law violations that may occur.

The operational achievements of the work were to:
identify traffic law violations that are relevant for traffic safety;
identify attitudes and opinions of driver and police personnel towards traffic law violations and police enforcement;
identify the legal considerations relevant to automatic detection, registration and processing of traffic law violations;
review the semiautomatic policing system currently in operation;
provide systems specifications for detection and registration systems;
predict acceptance of proposed systems on the basis of attitude surveys;
specify short term objectives for implementation.
The project will last 20 months. 
The primary objectives are to: 
- investigate the requirements automated policing systems will have to fulfil, 
- determine the type of automated policing systems that are feasible in the short term, 
- formulate recommendations for development and implementation.  
Secondary objectives are the: 
- identification of the type of violations that have a significant impact on traffic management efficiency, safety or pollution control, 
- analysis of police surveillance techniques and procedures to determine procedures that can be automated and can be incorporated in existing policing techniques, 
- identification of violations that are presently not covered by conventional surveillance techniques, 
- specification of the legal requirements for automated policing systems in the EC member countries, 
- analysis of existing (semi-) automated systems, 
- identification of the type of violations that are suitable for monitoring by automatic policing systems, 
- formulate recommendations for development of on-site and in-vehicle prototypes.

16922;V1051;DRIVE SAFELY;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Procedure for Safety Submissions for RTI Systems;;;;"The first objective of this project is to specify the procurement standards that will be required of both computer hardware and software components for use in road transport systems. The standards will specify the design methodologies that should be followed in order to produce products of acceptable quality and predictable performance. The scope of the standards will include computer systems used in vehicles, on the road side and computer systems used in some centralised or network configurations. These standards will, certain ways, be analogous to software and hardware standards used in the aviation industry.  
The second objective of this project is concerned with the process of certification by appropriate National or European Commission regulatory bodies of equipment for use in road transport systems. Initially a survey of the state of the art in standards for safety critical software, tools and techniques for the development of safety critical software and standards and techniques of testing hardware will be produced. Based on the findings of this survey draft standards for software and hardware and a safety classification for electronic systems will be developed. These classes will depend on safety implications of system failure an will impose requirements for documentation and test procedures.
The main objective of the research was to propose a certification procedure to ensure that the electronic hardware and software used in road transport informatics (RTI) systems, which are safety critical, are produced to the highest possible standards.

Research focussed on the following issues:
standards for testing computer hardware and software:
safety classification and corresponding requirements;
demonstrator cases;
safety programme plans;
safety standards on hardware and software;
standards for certification and type approval.

16955;V1018;TARDIS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Traffic and Roads - DRIVE integrated systems;;;;"The project is concerned with defining a global approach to the role of a common infrastructure in an Integrated Road Transport Environment (IRTE). The objective is to ensure that the functional requirements specifications of the common infrastructure are clearly stated, particularly from the point of view of the highway authorities responsible for overall traffic management. 
The project is designed to complement others which are more concerned with system design and development. It is particularly directed to the integration of the various demands which might be made of a single road infrastructure. The project aims to provide the authorities and other actors with the means for directly influencing the specification of the IRTE to ensure that their specific requirements are fully recognised.
The functional requirements of infrastructure based road transport informatics (RTI) systems have been examined using a general systems architecture with 5 layers. This structure has been used to analyse the functional requirements of a number of RTI systems grouped into 7 application areas. The formal description technique developed is particularly suited to the analysis of integration scenarios. Although concentration has been on physical functions, the analysis has remained technology neutral.

The functional analysis has been supported by the TARSIM simulation model, which simulates processing and communication within the RTI application. Processing is represented by the reception and production of information packets. Processing and transmission rates are specified by the user, who can then study queues and bottlenecks in the system. Traffic is represented as a random process, which results in the generation of messages with exponentially distributed gaps at detectors and beacons. TARSIM therefore complements the analysis based on the formal description technique. TARSIM therefore supports evaluation, system comparison, prediction, sensitivity analysis, design optimisation, bottleneck identification and the establishment of hardware requirements and costs.

A functional specification for automatic debiting, which meets the requirements of the motorway operators of France, Italy and Spain for automatic toll collection, as well as the Rijkswaterstaat for road pricing, has been produced. The advent of automatic debiting technology and automatic ticketing opens the possibility of a better sharing of costs among all beneficiaries. One can distinguish between the suppliers of transport services, the users, the beneficiaries and the payers where users, beneficiaries and payers need not necessarily be the same people. To achieve global safety, environmental and efficiency goals it is necessary to adopt an appropriate pricing policy, which essentially means that all beneficiaries should be taken into account.
The main work of the project will be in two sections: functional specification and standardization / legislative aspects. The analysis of the requirements of different actors will lead to agreed sets of functional requirements and specifications. The second group of tasks will address the requirements for international standards relating to the IRTE. 
The partners active in the specific work packages will report to a functional requirements committee which will implement the global systems approach to specifying the overall requirements of the IRTE.

16935;V1037;STAMMI;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Definition of Standards for In-Vehicle Man Machine Interface;;;;"The project will establish a technical framework for the production of ergonomic standards for in-vehicle man machine interface (MMI), together with appropriate performance criteria and values. On the machine side of the interface, these standards will ensure that the various elements of diverse in-vehicle systems are integrated to form a coherent total system. On the human side of the interface, the standards will ensure that the workload on the driver does not impair the safety of the driver or other road users.
Knowledge has been gained in the development of European standards for in vehicle man machine interaction (MMI). The purpose of this is to promote the design of information systems which are usable and, more importantly, which do not compromise driver safety.
This aim was achieved by completion of the following tasks:
a review of the current European environment with respect to existing in vehicle MMI standards; standards activities in other related areas (eg office information technology (IT)); relevant standards committees, procedures and documents; current legislation; and past and present research which could contribute to standards development;
the collation of supporting information for standards development, namely drivers' functional abilities and driving habits; the in vehicle noise environment and in vehicle lighting environment;
development of a list of MMI criteria, based on the literature, which can be used as a first step towards standards as well as a tool in the design and evaluation of future road transport informatics (RTI) systems with respect to human factors issues;
elicitation of the views of (current and potential) standards users on their requirements for the structure, content and use of MMI standards for RTI systems;
a discussion of the issues associated with the development and use of in vehicle MMI standards.
The knowledge gathered during these tasks has been reviewed and used to suggest a way forward for standards development in future research programmes.
Initial work will involve gathering of both documentary (existing MMI standards) and experimental data and the development of a framework for driver information. This framework will be built by incorporating survey results concerning information system use. These will allow the development of a set of standard criteria. The approach will be developed in conjunction with other relevant actors. The technical content will be checked by prototyping and experimental validation and in conjunction with the relevant DRIVE research teams.

16921;V1050;DRACO;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Driving Accident Coordinating Observer;;;;"The overall objective is to examine all facets of the specification, development, provision, use and application of a vehicle data recorder. This device is intended to provide data which can be used to reduce the number of accidents. An accident is often the result of many interacting factors - the DRACO recorder must address all the relevant factors.
The research, given the title project DRACO (driving accident coordinating observer), was involved in defining a system comprising an in-vehicle component, which monitors and records aspects of vehicle status during accidents, and an off-vehicle component which calibrates and stores the data after an accident. DRACO is intended to be a black-box type of recorder specifically tailored for fitting to a road vehicle for the collection of data associated with accidents involving that vehicle. Research covers the benefits to vehicle drivers or owners and road transport informatics (RTI) in general with respect to road safety issues.

Research has focused on:
identification of the end users of DRACO type data and specification of their interests;
specification of the on vehicle DRACO together with the standards against which it must be tested;
development of an algorithm for the detection of a vehicle impact;
proof that acceleration and yaw data as generated from low cost commercially available transducers will permit satisfactory reconstruction of vehicle trajectory;
recommendations to the European Parliament on the possible mandatory implementation of the DRACO system.
The primary objectives of the project are: 
- to examine the road / vehicle / driver relationship as a multifaceted system that has failed when an accident has occurred, 
- to examine the utility of DRACO in monitoring and analysing accidents in order to influence equipment specifications and define event processing requirements, 
- to investigate the acceptability of such a 'Draconian' device where the Driver monitoring aspect of the Road-Vehicle-Driver system will undoubtedly introduce problems of both a technical and psychological nature. 
The project's secondary objectives relate to involving end users and introduce some market place influences. In detail they are: 
- to identify perceivable benefits for the private motorist and to specify and design any processing service that may be necessary to achieve those benefits, 
- to research advantages for the fleet operator in particular for operational efficiency, 
- to research all areas of cost saving as a result of implementing DRACO and its attendant post event analysis functions. 
It is expected that the Industrial partners involved in the DRACO project will contribute some form of equipment prototype to assist in testing the concepts at a later stage.

17052;A 1033 (8014);EUCLIDES;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;A European Standard for Clinical Laboratory Data Exchange between Independent Information Systems;;;;"The primary objective is to improve the communication of Laboratory Information between hospitals, doctors and laboratories. 
A project has been initiated to provide a European standard for clinical laboratory data exchange between independent and heterogeneous medical information systems, which is unbiased towards any manufacturer's hardware or software. This could be extended to other fields of medicine. 4 areas of application have been defined:
patient related data;
control-sera related data (ie transmission of data for external quality assessment programmes);
test related data;
laboratory related supervision data. 2 distinct classes of messages were used: system messages (eg for the transfer of metadata);
data messages containing laboratory related information. The message structure is defined and identified unambiguously by the syntax which uses an object oriented approach. The syntax has been designed so that each data element is tagged directly, and each object represents a single real world concept with no overlapping. This results in early upgrading when new elements have to be added, early maintainability and no reprogramming efforts. The project adapted the CCITT x.400 series of recommendations designed to guide the system implementor towards achieving a complete, secure and open massaging system. The key elements addressed for the transfer mechanism were:
user friendliness;
multitude of platforms, to ensure a maximum freedom of choice for the user;
assurance of adequate confidentiality and integrity measures;
possibility of using many forms of communication media;
easy implementation;
easy and cost effective upgradability and maintainability. The standard has been designed to cover the following branches of clinical pathology:
clinical chemistry, toxicology;
haematology, immunology, haemostasis;
microbiology (bacteriology, serology). A bridge package was designed to facilitate communication from and to any local information system. A number of subsystems were also developed for error handling and syntax and system maintenance.
The objective in itself is a leading initiative ; what is more remarkable is the three prong approach to this issue. We have identified three essential levels : 
- semantics ; 
- syntax ; 
- layered reference model. 
Furthermore we have identified the key areas which interlink the three. 
In the following chapters we propose : 
- to standardize Laboratory Specific Information exchanges, 
- to simplify and accelerate the collection, retrieval and maintenance of the LSI ; 
- to ensure complete independence for LSI exchanges ; 
- to propose cost effective ways for LSI exchanges ; 
- to propose methods that ensure compliance with medical data protection, confidentiality, consistency and integrity ; 
- to promote our achievements to European and International acceptance ; 
- to prove concretely the results of our project in pilot implementations ; 
- to employ fully the offers of participation of reputable medical establishments placed in nearly all Member States for the setting up of a first real European integrated medical environment. 
The use of prototyping techniques, data model analysis and development techniques, the use of CCITT defined recommendations and the proposed link with other CEC projects and facilities are also of considerable importance and are foreseen in our project. The combinations of all the elements above will ensure the establishment of a real International standard and more importantly one which will consider the users' needs first. Only this way we can achieve real European adhesion as AIM has specifically set out to establish.

17045;A1010 (8705);EPIAM;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;A Knowledge Based System for Epidemiology;;;;"The aim of the project is to design an integrated environment for the management of an epidemiological study. The environment will support the overall life cycle of a survey, particularly relating to the following aspects : 
- study planning ; 
- study monitoring ; 
- statistical analysis of the data collected during the study. 
From the application point of view, the use of specific epidemiological analysis tools is a general need inside all the national health care institutions and a wide range of professionals at all level are now involved (clinicians, administrators, planners).

So there should be a significant potential impact in the whole epidemiological field for a tool, like the one prototyped by EPIAIM, which:
enables non experts in information technologies to use sophisticated data handling and statistical functions;
enforces and supports a correct planning of the epidemiological studies using a formalized formulation of the methodology to be applied.

The system should support a wide range of applications, aside from epidemiology, if the application dependent knowledge base is replaced with another context development. For example, another possible application field, pointed out by ENIDATA, is the forecasting of user requests in gas transport or electricity distribution networks.
The identification of the environment requirements will be based of the alternative technical and methodological approaches to a study, of the reasoning process behind the formulation of a survey hypothesis and of the inference process involved in its verification. 
The validation of such requirements will be carried out on the basis of some already concluded epidemiological surveys to be considered as 'study cases'. 
The project evolution will be followed by a team of epidemiologists and statisticians to control its right setting out. 
A special attention will be given to the user-system interface, that will be studied so as to make the interaction style as best suited to the various user needs, as possible. 
The main expected results are : 
a) the definition of a conceptual framework where different types of epidemiological studies can be modeled ; 
b) the definition of the functional requirements and the environment architecture for : 
- knowledge acquisition and representation ; 
- knowledge-based building of tools to be used for the survey management (data bases, questionnaires, data entry forms, data quality control) ; 
- selection and application of appropriate statistical strategies ; 
c) the definition of an interface able to adapt the interaction style to user and task models.

17043;A1006 (8327);KISS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Knowledge-based Interactive Signal monitoring System;;;;"An architecture for medical equipment and a system for patient monitoring at coronary care units has been developed.

Before any clinical application, the KISS framework for a new generation of knowledge based real time medical monitoring systems has to be proven on the currently developed KISS prototype simulating a coronary care environment.

The projected framework allows:
the design of an interactive intelligent monitoring workstation with a high degree of operational autonomy and flexibility;
the development of an intelligent monitoring system generator for customized systems;
the standardization of data communication and storage, both in critical care units, departments and other hospital systems;
specification of hardware and software requirements for real time problems with a high data input flow and time critical decision making.

Use of combined signals is not usually found in commercially available equipment. Added to this combination is the knowledge of some prevalent heart diseases and the anatomy of the heart and its electrical functions. The result should be able to drastically reduce false alarms in the coronary care unit (CCU). The prototype should be able to handle any combination of signals (ECG, phonocardiogram, EEG, blood pressure, respiration) and derived as well as independent (but related) parameters.
Irrespective of their specific medical area, new generations of interactive medical monitoring workstations will integrate 'Knowledge Technology' to adequately and autonomously measure, process, and interpret sensor signals to indicate the current patient state. The development of these systems can be greatly improved by means of a general framework that provides means to formalize the functional description of a medical monitoring system in a concise and implementation independent manner. This improvement stems from the fact that such a framework promotes a more structured development approach, the reusability of existing components, and a standard for communication. 
To define such a general framework appropriate issues within the area of medical monitoring must be addressed. Within the KISS project the following issues are deemed vital : 
- real-time knowledge-based processing integrating different knowledge representation techniques such as deep and shallow knowledge, spatio-temporal relations, uncertainties, and reasoning methods such as progressive and assumption-based reasoning ; 
- adaptive behaviour towards changes in the patient state by means of memorizing, updating capabilities together with consistency maintenance ; 
- integration of algorithmic methods and knowledge-based methods for sensor signal conditioning and feature extraction ; 
- specification of context-sensitive and user-oriented user-interfaces with capabilities to provide a relevant overview of the current situation. 
Verification of the ideas, gained by the study of these issues, will be carried out in an experimental system for a representative medical care environment, i.e. a Coronary Care Unit. 
Results from this project in the shape of the general framework provide a sound basis for further developments such as automatic system development by means of an Intelligent Monitoring System Generator and standardization activities for data- and knowledge-storage and communication.

16951;V1024;DIS;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Driver Information Systems;;;;"The goal of the project is to specify the integration of existing systems into a comprehensive driver information system operating across Europe. The first objective of the project is to define the nature of driver information systems by: 
- determining and evaluating users information requirements, 
- evaluating alternative technical methods for data handling, 
- and by the development of information generation and dissemination procedures.
The research has resulted in a handbook containing recommendations for performance standards of driver information systems.

The object of the Handbook is to:
direct manufacturers to develop and produce driver information system components which can be used all over Europe;
influence information providers to develop databases and value added services that meet the requirements of an integrated European information system;
enable public and private transport organisations to make their information and traffic control systems compatible with driver information systems;
help administrators and authorities implement driver information systems which can be integrated in a European driver information network;
give drivers a guarantee that they will have access to certain types of information wherever they are travelling in Europe.

A list of advanced software tools was specified which, based on various data sources, establish and manage a comprehensive information system. Existing algorithms were described and characterised according to their requirements and potential efficiency. In addition, possible physical units were investigated which may be components of a coherent information system and which can realise any given set of applications at different levels of technological development. General rules and principles for networking, standardisation and information dissemination have also been elaborated.

The research resulted in a proposal for a system architecture to permit substantial volumes of data to be passed between numerous (public and private) actors. That architecture requires the creation of a TDI network involving the interworking of various communications networks based on international standard messages. Two principle components are needed to realised this requirement:
a common network interface attachment facility;
messages incorporating standard location referencing, syntax and rules.

An additional requirement identified, but as yet not resolved, is the need to create appropriate management and financial regimes. Possible management models are suggested, although detailed analysis has not been possible.

The research led to the following results:
hardware units and software tools;
a modular structure was elaborated;
a general framework for a comprehensive information system was obtained;
it was shown how different activities in road transport informatics development are integrated into a cooperative overall system;
synergetic effects were made evident;
feasible structures for information flow were derived.

A European driver information system (DIS) has been developed based on an examination of existing driver information systems in operation inside and outside of Europe. The systems which could be integrated into the European concept and the experience gained from the structure and operation of these systems were taken into account.

The research provided recommendations in the following areas:
driver information requirements;
requirements for data collection and transmission;
data processing and control issues;
information transmission and dissemination mechanisms;
information reception requirements of users.

The characteristics of 79 existing worldwide driver information systems were studied with regard to their relevance to a panEuropean system. Data was also collected and analysed from an extensive study of the available literature and from in depth semistructured interviews carried out in Norway and Greece. This resulted in a system architecture for a future comprehensive driver information system which consists of 5 different levels. At the lowest level is the individual vehicle and at the highest is the international road network. The intermediate levels are the local, regional and national levels. Each level contains a number of control centres which interchange data horizontally with other centres in the same level and vertically with adjacent levels. This hierarchical structure makes it possible to integrate organizational and technological structures, which are different in each region and country into common functions that can be understood by all drivers in all regions at the individual vehicle level.
Initially a review and analysis of existing systems will be carried out in order to establish the current state of the art. This will take into account all kinds of information systems and research will then concentrate on in-vehicle systems. 
Based on both the results of the two above steps and on the results of other DRIVE tasks, recommendations for a pan-European in-vehicle information system will be developed. 
In preparing these recommendations following aspects will be explicitly considered: 
- legal factors (data protection, legislation) 
- public authorities (road, police, etc.) 
- distribution channels ( broadcasters, roadside beacons, etc.) 
Conflicts between national standards will be highlighted and resolved in the proposed pan-European standard. 
Regular liaison with other European initiatives (for example Eureka projects) is planned.

16968;V1001;BARTOC;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Bus Advanced Real Time Operational Control;;;;"On the basis of operational experience of existing Vehicle Scheduling and Control Systems (VSCS) and the research work of the partners, the project will aim at the definition and specification of a new generation of more efficient and lower cost VSCS. New generation VSCS will be capable of interacting with other RTI systems.
The project for bus advanced real time operational control (BARTOC) aims to define a new generation of more efficient and less expensive vehicle scheduling and control systems (VSCS) for public networks, acting in real time for improving services. The technical approach is to take the results of existing vehicle scheduling and control systems and of related systems (fare collection, user information, priority at crossroads), to review the users requirements in order to identify those not met by the existing VSCS, to review the evolution of the environment of such systems, to define the external functions of the system and how to implement them, with feasibility studies carried out for new technologies, to integrate the above defined function in order to specify the structure best able to implement these functions with flexibility and efficiency, to specify recommended system design and to specify a demonstration project to assess the anticipated benefits.

The research investigated the reasons why many urban public transport companies have adopted vehicle supervisory control systems (VSCS) as a means of controlling an improving the operation of their bus fleets. The research focused on the new generation of VSCS's which incorporate radio communication networks, bus location techniques, high performance regulation algorithms, automatic fare collection systems and advanced passenger information.

The research concluded that the new generation of VSC's offers the following advantages:

For bus operators:
there is a good range of equipment and functions that meet the requirements of any type of bus operation in any European city;
increased potential for integrating the VSCS into the bus company's computerized systems;
these are operational cost reductions;
new regulation algorithms and expert systems are available;
data acquisition helps bus service decision making;
standardized VSCS equipment is available.

For transport authorities:
the VSCS can be integrated with other civil computerized systems (eg traffic, routing, information, etc);
improved public transport image for users;
reduction of vehicle pollution;
there can be a better understanding of transportation problems and data acquisition to help decision making.

For staff:
improved system use for operators (drivers, regulators);
increased security for staff and passengers.

For passengers:
easier to used public transport;
increased comfort;
the availability accurate information concerning bus services, especially at bus stops.

For manufacturers:
reduced manufacturing costs;
well established and defined standards for equipment and software.

User information systems (or computer aided information systems) play an important part in the interface between the public transport network and its customers. This research investigated what the user wants, the different levels of passenger information systems available (at home, in the street, at bus stops, on the bus), how to disseminate this information, and how to make it publically available. The effects of malfunctions in different parts of the system and ways of avoiding them were also investigated. Maintenance requirements and the effects of vandalism were considered.
The technical approach will be to: 
- survey the performance of existing VSCS and related systems (for fare collection, user information, prioritising trips, schedule design and so on) which may require integration with the VSCS. 
- review the users' requirements and the evolution of the environment of such systems. 
- define the external functions of the system and how to implement them. 
- integrate these functions in order to specify the structure and the components (hardware and software) of the system. 
- specify recommended system design and draft proposals for European standards. 
- design & specify a demonstration project to be used to assess the benefits of the improved VSCS.

16932;V1043;CIDER;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;DRIVE Integrated Telecommunications;;;;"This project is designed to examine the demands for telecommunications of all kinds within the DRIVE network, and to formulate recommendations on the optimum methods and systems for dealing with this information flow in the most cost-effective manner. The key objectives are to identify the needs for information flows in terms of data rates, accuracy and priority and to produce system definitions and recommendations for all the mobile and fixed network communications required for services identified during the DRIVE programme. The systems adopted to handle these flows must have reliability of operation, technological viability, appropriate growth potential, and compatibility of standards throughout the required geographical areas. They must also recognise the wider communication environments within which the systems operate, and the work must assess costs and benefits in terms of both the initial choice of technologies and their subsequent effectiveness.
Many aspects associated with the integration of telecommunications for road transport informatics (RTI) have been examined in detail. These aspects include analyses of both functional requirements and the capabilities of bearer networks. In addition, an analysis of interconnection techniques led to the development of the DRIVE normalised data transmission (DNT) and the optimum interconnection of applications and networks, based on the open systems interconnection (OSI) model. The analyses have made use of models and simulations, formulated within the study, to achieve this optimum matching.
The systems considered to handle the data flows were chosen as they satisfied the following criteria, reliability of operation, technological viability, appropriate growth potential and compatibility of standards throughout Western Europe. The costs and benefits of these systems in terms of both the initial choice of technology and their subsequent effectiveness were taken into account, as well as the wider communication environments in which they will operate.

The key issues for the study were:
definition of integrated road transport environment (IRTE) communications architecture;
characterisation of the information flow required by the IRTE in terms of volumes of information, data rates, and the accuracies, securities and priorities required;
assessment of the applicability of the communication systems available;
recommendation of the fixed and mobile communication networks appropriate for the services identified during the DRIVE programme;
collaboration with other DRIVE projects, standards bodies and telecommunication network operators.

After analysis of available communication systems and protocols used in different systems it was concluded that no existing system fulfils all the needs of the DRIVE project. Therefore, the idea of defining a standard interface, which was to be called DNT (DRIVE normalised transmission) emerged. The DNT concept includes a well defined interface to application layers and it is the responsibility of the DNT layer to select the most suitable bearer service for the use of an application with the help of an optimum routing process. Also the possible internetworking should be done by the DNT.
Advantages of the DNT that have been identified are:
the provision of a standard interface for road transport informatics (RTI) application designers;
facilitation of the addition of new applications;
the provision of RTI applications on multiple bearer networks leading to larger markets;
facilitation of competition between telecommunication network operators for RTI data traffic;
extensive use of open protocols and alignment with the European Commission's policy of open network provision.

Telecommunications networks have been investigated for their specific applicability to road transport informatics (RTI), with a view to their eventual integration into an integrated road transport environment (IRTE). A comprehensive computer database has been produced of communication traffic profiles of all known RTI and RTI related applications and RTI services have been classified according to bearer requirements.
An understanding of the data flows for traveller information and trip planning applications is deemed to be essential before a communications architecture can be designed. 14 applications and estimated data flows have been studied and the data flows between vehicles and infrastructure have been estimated and described by an information flow diagram. The data flows were then dimensioned in terms of urgency, reliability, security and number of bytes required. An estimation of likely vehicle densities then allowed an indication of data generated by an application over a given area to be predicted.

The problem of the integrity of data, in the sense of maintaining or retrieving a data quality criterion measured by bit error rates under given circumstances or values of key parameters such as vehicle speed, data rate or coverage area, on DRIVE communications channels has been addressed.
The following communications channels were studied, modelled and software simulated:
the vehicle to vehicle channel;
the beacon to vehicle using the radio channel;
the beacon to vehicle using the infrared channel;
the GSM-SDCCH channel;
the land mobile to satellite channel, in particular using L-band.

The integrated road transport environment (IRTE) will offer the road user access to road transport informatics (RTI) applications on a pan-European basis. However, future mobile communication systems will cover only the urban and suburban areas and the main routes. Studies have been conducted on the communication systems for extraurban areas, and in particular land mobile satellite systems (LMSS) and ground mobile systems.
Particular achievements have included:
identification and analysis of a number of existing and planned ground system configurations;
consideration of modifications for the above systems that will better meet the needs of RTI;
definition of possible configurations of land mobile satellite systems (LMSS);
outlining of possible alternatives and evolutions of LMSS.

A framework has been provided for discussing communication principles in an integrated road transport environment. The framework addresses some of the often confusing points about the intent, applicability and implementation of road transport informatics (RTI) communication systems, and consists of:
a set of terms to facilitate discussions on open communications (ie communication by means of a preagreed set of standards protocols);
models to engineer simplified and relevant replicas of the open communication scenarios under consideration.
Among others, the following issues are addressed: enterprise aspects of RTI distributed systems and processing, informational aspects, computational aspects, engineering aspects, technological aspects, RTI versus open systems interconnection (OSI), RTI versus open distributed processing (ODP), relationships between abstract items, such as protocols in the DRIVE normalised data transmission (DNT), and their concrete representation in RTI real systems, validation techniques including formal description languages and tools, the management and security of RTI communication systems, etc.
A set of closely related tasks is taken from the Workplan to form a coherent Project. The aim is to identify and analyse the requirements for transfer of information, advice, and (where necessary) control instructions within DRIVE, and to assess the applicability of possible communication networks. An essential element of the project is to achieve concertation with the telecommunications requirements which will emerge from other projects as the DRIVE programme progresses. Close contact will be maintained with other consortia, by interchange of system and technical information as the work develops. 
Main Deliverables:

16931;V1042;ITHACA;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;In-Depth Accident Data Collection and Analysis;;;;"The project objective is to design an accident documentation process for in-depth accident data collection and analysis to be able to asses future developments in traffic safety.
The objectives of ITHACA are to consider theory of accident factors, in particular as they are related to the human factors, in the accident causation process, to define the state of the art (accuracy, consistency of data) and requirements for the use of accident information, to define a new common prototype proforma which can be used by the European Community for in depth accident data collection and to build a prototype expert system for in depth accident investigations concentrating on human factors.
On the basis of literature studies and active accident investigations by police, car/insurance companies and in depth teams a prototype of a new European accident protocol for in depth investigations will be developed, containing road transport informatics (RTI) relevant parameters. Within the parameters the focus lies on human factors and on the precrash phase. Human factors are the main reasons in the accident influence field. The main effort of this project is the development of a knowledge based system (expert system) for accident data analysis.
The project concentrates on in depth investigations with limited accident data collection. It is designed to set up a very small data bank that can be used to illustrate the possibilities of a knowledge based system for the evaluation of safety impacts of new RTI-components.
A prototype was made available on 01/09/92

Information on the accident risk potential of driving tasks and of traffic situations is of great relevance to the development, evaluation and implementation of safety related road transport informatics (RTI) measures. This research was into the design of a European proforma for in depth accident data collection. In depth accident investigations are intended to collect detailed information on factors contributing to accidents via a trained team of experts from different disciplines at the scene of an accident.

We adopted a generic approach of looking at all associated factors and phases of accidents. The emphasis, however, lay on human factors and the precrash phase of the accident. A new prototype accident data collection proforma basedon a multilevel, modular structure for the required variables was proposed. The prototype proforma will serve as a basis for the design of a new panEuropean disaggregate accident data collection proforma.

Many in depth accident studies are carried out in order to reveal not only where the transportation system failed, but also what exactly failed and why parts of the system failed. The aim of this research was to develop a method, supported by a computer expert system, of clarifying the causation of road accidents. The starting point in our study is the system view in which we consider the human operator interacting with the other components such as the environment and the vehicle. In the transportation system all human participants work towards a common goal; to travel from one place to another. This teleological viewpoint can also be found in the task driven approach that we used in the accident analyses.

In order to reach his or her goal and to arrive safely at the place he or she had planned to travel to the road user has to carry out several traffic tasks. Apart from more strategic considerations such as route choice the road user will be concerned with the execution of several manoeuvres during his or her participation in the transportation system. Task analyses prescribe hierarchically ordered rules for carrying out the manoeuvres. These rules (tasks) are incorporated into the expert system and are used by the system as a frame of reference in the analysis of individual accidents.

The first working prototype expert system was limited to the analysis of individual accidents, however, the development of a method for aggregated accident analysis, in which the outcomes of the individual analyses will act as input, is underway.

A new task model was developed to overcome deficiencies in older task models and this new model has become an important part of the developed task driven analysis. The task driven analysis was found to be most fruitful as a method for analyzing accidents at a microscopic level. In task driven analysis risk variables are directly linked with human task performance. With the help of this method, that has been implemented in the protot ype expert system, the relationship between human, vehicle, environment, road factors and the accident can be made clear. These relationships are especially relevant for designers of road transport informatics (RTI) systems who have to know when and how their systems should support the road user in the road traffic system.
The work will encompass the following areas:  
- Requirements for in-depth data collection and analysis in view of potential user groups. 
- Analysis potential of existing in-depth accident data collection methods. 
- Development of a new European proforma in modular structure for in-depth accident investigation. 
- A prototype road expert system for road accident data in-depth studies.

18755;V1060;SMART;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Electronic Cards for Traffic and Transport;;;;"The objectives of this project are to explore the fields of application of electronic cards to improve the efficiency and safety of both individual and public transport. 
More precisely the main goals are: 
1 To identify areas of Pan-European applications in individual and public transport and to assess the costs and benefits of different applications as well as their market potentials. 
2 To select, outline and evaluate one application for technical development, i.e. a complete system with all its components (cards, read/write equipment, transmission equipment interfacing systems, etc...)
The research project, titled SMART, aimed at developing an intelligent information carrier for different transport applications. The objective of the project was to explore the fields of application for electronic microprocessor smart cards in European individual and public transport and to select and to evaluate one such application for prototype development.

The following results have been obtained:
the 2 main types of cards identified are the payment card and the portable file card (The payment card is presently being developed for individual and public transport payment in urban areas in Scandinavia and the portable file card was developed for administrative purposes, especially for truck and car fleet monitoring and freight administration);
a card accepting device for vehicles has been outlined;
shortcomings have been identified that influence the feasibility of the card system;
the current generation of cards have been found to be good enough for pilot testing;
the crucial point for early implementation scenarios has been identified as the lack of standardisation.
The technical approach taken by the project is to investigate potential fields of application and assess the consequent markets for alternative types of more or less sophisticated cards. Given the objective of universal and simple use, compatibility problems will be studied and the possibility of standardizing the information held on the cards (in terms of type, format, structure and density) will be explored. The consequences for users, manufacturers public transport operators, freight transport companies and traffic authorities will be studied. 
A prototype development for a selected application will be produced.

17050;A 1025 (8016);ICSIC;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Integrated COmmunication System for Intensive Care;;;;"The goal of the project is to propose a common framework for Intensive Care Units Computer Systems. These are primarily considered as communication and coordination instruments for all medical and nursing team activities, both at the individual and the group levels. Such a goal requires complete integration into the computer system of not only patient data management (including on-line and manual data acquisition, storage, retrieval, processing) but also of user tasks organization and coordination, as well as background knowledge utilization (context and referents information). 
Work has concentrated on action coordination in intensive care units (ICU), since many operational problems result from human interactions in large teams where responsibilities are shared and actions are distributed.
The structure of actions in ICUs was modelled in terms of scenarios (ie recurrent organization of work). Workflows are the building blocks of the scenarios, and workflow management is the basis of nursing, care and support of medical activities.

A complex database structure has been designed and an innovative human computer interaction scheme has been conceived and implemented. It is currently being tested in the field. Applications are expected beyond the ICU world.
To support these activities, an innovative technological platform is being tested. Short term exploitation of the results was achieved through a fast development of spin off systems.
The solutions are not specific for intensive care, but are applicable to other medium sized human teams working in a closed environment and involved in high intensity data processing tasks.
The framework consists of the following inter-related parts : 
- data and knowledge base for treatment and user activity follow-up and decision making ; 
- man machine communication system based on a context and referents dependency model for efficient self focusing and information selection, including a 'language' and physical tools for system control and data entry (Integrated Medical Human Interface) ; 
- a software structure, which is open to add on specialized programs, including a proposal for a standardized operating system environment and network protocols to allow the implementation at computers of different suppliers. 
The specification of such framework will be based upon an analysis of several hospitals in Europe. Prototypes will be developed and implemented in different intensive care units in four hospitals in three EEC countries, as local computer networks, connected to the Hospital Information System. 
The project represents a shift of emphasis from mainly data-oriented medical computer systems (as most current systems are) to mainly user-oriented systems for the support of daily activities of physicians and nurses in medical departments. Better user acceptance should result and the effectiveness of computer support of medical care should automatically increase. The methodology used in the project will lead to results which may have implications for medical departments in general, and not only for Intensive Care units.

17044;A 1021 (8411);KAVAS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;A Knowledge Acquisition, Visualization and Assessment Study;;;;"This project aims at exploring methods and techniques that will facilitate a reduction of one of the major problems in medicine : the data and information pollution. As human capability in handling large amounts of information is limited, knowledge-based technology has been proposed as the solution. Practice has shown that current methods for building such KBSs result in systems that are not general enough to be widely used. So, a tool is needed, which enables medical experts to acquire and refine their knowledge, to assess the quality and transferability of the knowledge and to justify each information item in relation to problem solving. 
KAVAS is designing a research and development tool for medical experts, supporting them in developing and assessing their knowledge (domain models, knowledge bases). The expertise may be exploited for implementation of knowledge bases systems (KBS). Hence, the long term plans for application in the health care services is concerned with general applications in medicine. Three specific medical domains were selected for first experiments: clinical medicine, laboratory investigations and health performance indicators. In these domains information technology (IT) will certainly play an important role, and will have to cope with characteristics such as data abundance, data absence, noise, uncertainty, temporal aspects, transfer needs, etc.

The evaluation methodology could form the basis of a standard.

Potential for patent application seems to be present with respect to the framework for quality assessment as an integrated part of KBS development.
The project focuses on the definition of a knowledge acquisition tool for the development of correct, valid and transferable medical decision support systems. Both knowledge engineering techniques and machine learning techniques have their advantages and shortcomings. Our ultimate goal is to develop a system that integrates the strong points of both these approaches to knowledge acquisition together with methodologies for validation of knowledge bases/knowledge based systems in a way that optimizes their transferability. 
During the 'AIM Exploratory Action' existing techniques will be explored in order to assess their potentials, and an action plan for further development and integration of techniques will be defined. Also possible approaches to the solution of problems for which techniques and technology are currently missing will be identified. Experimentation will be part of the technical approach. The medical domains selected for experimentation are clinical chemistry and health care management, both seriously affected by the problem of data pollution. 
The main issues are : 
- establish the framework and functionality for a knowledge acquisition tool for medical decision support systems ; 
- analyze methods and approaches which utilize current machine learning techniques to extract knowledge from medical data bases ; 
- explore approaches to elicit knowledge from medical experts and their ability to handle deep knowledge ; 
- explore approaches to visualize knowledge structures and concepts ; 
- identify potential metrics for quality assurance and quality control of knowledge embedded in a KB ; 
- define procedures for user evaluation of medical decision support systems, and perform initial experimentation ; 
- establish from experimentation a series of requirements for knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and validation that will increase transferability of KBSs and KBs. 
The role of the tool defined and planned is an assistant for medical experts, not another tool for the knowledge engineer. 
Main Deliverables :

17058;A 1027 (8310);BIOLAB;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;An Integrated Biomedical Laboratory;;;;"The BIOLAB project aims at the elaboration of an IBL concept through the specification, design and prototyping of an IBL, constructed around a powerful workstation integrating various application-specific biomedical units. The integration is envisaged to be based on common interfaces and formats both between the biomedical laboratory units and to the outside world. 
The hardware and software specifications of a biomedical laboratory workstation have been considered, through which various heterogeneous medical information systems can be accessed. The hardware specification of the workstation has been completed, as well as the specification of a language for accessing the various heterogeneous medical information components (such as a medical image processing module, a neural network classifier, and a neural network diagnostic system). The topics addressed were: 
the architecture of the integrated biomedical laboratory (IBL) including workstation, module architectures and interfaces; 
medical image processing and interpretation (including generic tools for medical image processing and interpretation, interaction of numeric and symbolic reasoning, robustness for change in specifications of data and processing elements); 
knowledge based and database units (including the design of a common language and integration in a heterogeneous computing environment); 
artificial neural net classifier units (including the application to general medical diagnosis and automatic histology, and the architecture definition and very large scale integration design specifications); 
integration of the IBL modules; 
liaison with ongoing work concerning standards. 

The workstation specifications and message passing system specifications for the implementation layer have already been used in the design of a powerful workstation. The accessing language has been defined in Backus-Naur form. The data format transformer has been developed and the software demonstrated. Several image processing components have been developed. Also a study has been performed on having a parallel processing machine for image processing applications requiring heavy computation. A demonstrator has been developed for the use of neural network technology in automating the diagnostic decision support mechanism in histopathology. Image processing and decision support systems are only 2 examples of the medical information systems considered.
The topics, addressed in the project are : the architecture of the IBL (including workstation and module architectures and interfaces), medical image processing and interpretation (including generic tools for medical image processing and interpretation, interaction of numeric computing and symbol reasoning, robustness for changes in the specifications of data and processing elements), knowledge base and database units (including the design of a common language and integration in a heterogeneous computing environment), artificial neural net classifier units (including the application to general medical diagnosis and automated histology, and including the architecture definition and VLSI design specifications), integration of the IBL modules and the liaison with ongoing work concerning standards. 
As a result of our initial discussions, we have identified a grouping of European institutions with complementary interests, which are supported by various national and internationals bodies. The scale of resources required, and the range of expertise it will call on, means that the project is very unlikely to take place under a single national research programme. In this project, three leading universities, two hospitals, and two information technology companies are proposing to co-ordinate their efforts to realize an integrated biomedical laboratory concept. They will seek advice from external consultants concerning the requirements exposed in related AIM projects, European and international standards, and VLSI design for critical components. Most of the partners are involved in relevant European research projects and will bring their expertise into the project, e.g. the ESPRIT SPAN project and ESPRIT VIEWS, .. which will ensure the transfer of general information technology to the applied biomedical research domain. 
The project will also accommodate for some of the requirements exposed in relevant AIM tasks such as T550 : Medical Image and Signal Interpretation, T540 : Integration of KBS Methodology with Other Procedures, T310 : Clinical Data and Process Modelling and T611 : In Vivo Sensors for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Support. The BIOLAB project may therefore be viewed as a major contribution to the overall objectives of AIM in the European scene.

17041;A 1040 (8013 - 8326);MMOMS;;FP2-AIM 1;;FP2;Multi-Modality Organ Modelling System;;;;"The project Objective is to produce the user and technical requirements for a clinical useful Multi-Model Organ Modelling System. 
We define a multi-model organ modelling system (MMOMS) to mean a system which would take patient data from different modalities, such as CT, DSA, MRI, PET and SPECT, and the `reference modality' of a digital atlas of anatomical and possibly physiological and pathophysiological data and with these produce and interpret a range of 2D, 3D and time sequence multi-modality (MM) images. These MM images may give `added-value' either through features which can only be derived from more than one image modality or by those which can be better visualised or made more directly quantifiable than through the interpretation of a single modality. Such a MMOMS could aid the clinician and medcial scientist in the following activities : 
 the overal diagnostic process by alowing; 
- tissue characterization identifying lesion type and structure, 
- quantification of the extent and nature of abnormalities; 
 therapy planning by allowing; 
- more accurate estimates of size and position, 
- pathologies to be followed through over time, 
- surgical simulation; 
 teaching via interactive multi-parameter presentation. 

There is considerable ongoing activity in this area in European and American centres; however, we know of no in depth analysis of the clinical and technical requirements for a usable MMOMS for the mid to late 1990's. 
In this project we propose to produce a series of detailed reports on a MMOMS for the brain as most of the imaging modalities have been applied to it and the brain has a complex relationship between topography and function/malfunction. The reports will specify; 
- the facilities likely to be required by clinicians; 
- the range of technically feasible facilities and their difficulties if implementation; 
- some of the possible facilities that may be developed in the next few years if difficult technical problems can be overcome; 
- an indication of the information processing and presentation resources which are likely to be necessary to overcome the technical problems; 
- the types of clinician-computer interfaces. 
This proposed work is motivated by the hypothesis that a MMOMS will lead to improved patient care at a better cost benefit ratio. The validity of this assertion will be examined as part of the final report and critical issues for detailed investigation during the main phase will be identified. 
This work will also provide insight into the long term viability of building Object Oriented Simulation System for Computer Aided Reasoning in Medicine (OSCAR), which will enable the user to perform a computer simulation of human pathological changes.

16961;V1014;IMAURO;;FP2-DRIVE 1;;FP2;Integrated Model for the Analysis of Urban Route Optimization;;;;"The project's objective is to build a dynamic traffic test model for RTI applications in small urban areas. This will be used to test applications such as traffic information, delivery advice or ordering, route planning, route guidance systems, collision avoidance systems, incident detection, etc.
The main goal of the project was to prove the feasibility of certain methodologies in the arena of transportation research. As a result of the project, pilot versions of new modelling tools and measurement techniques have been developed and experimented.
The integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) is an urban dynamical traffic assignment simulation model, sensitive to various road transport informatics (RTI) effects, able to predict and show the effects of broadcast information on travel times, traffic density and flow rates. IMAURO is conceived as an integrated tool with a modular structure: data acquisition, database and simulation model.
The IMAURO project introduced innovative techniques to realise its ambitious objective of integrating 3 submodels which are responsive to road transport informatics (RTI) and which operate on different levels of network detail, thus realising a dynamic traffic simulation tool. These innovative techniques include a rule language for describing driver behaviour in an integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IRTE), a representation for the information network of the IRTE, a representation for road networks at various levels of detail, a representation for perceived sections of a road network, a method for merging and splitting vehicle packets, improved devices for automatic road data collection, a method for integrating 3 simulation submodels per time slice, and a method for showing simulation results using a graphical user interface.
The resulting IMAURO implementation, which demonstrates these techniques, was shown to be adaptable to a realistic urban network, namely, the urban agglomeration of the Belgian city of Namur. Test runs, with a simple demand derived from the available data at FUNDP, have been executed with simulation of an event on a major road section alongside the river Meuse. These tests have shown that the evolution of flows and costs, for a same demand and an identical incident time and location, is different depending on the availability of RTI procuring information about the incident to the drivers. However, a real dynamical demand model for the city of Namur is not available at this time and should be used to be able to validate the models. In any case further development of the mesoscopic simulation model and of the cost model are necessary to produce a commercial product.

A major innovation of the integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) was the development of a rule language used to describe the behaviour of drivers in an integrated road transport environment (IRTE). The language has a friendly syntax and permits the behaviour of drivers in specific traffic scenarios to be described clearly, concisely and unambiguously. A set of such rules, constituting a behaviourial theory, may be accumulated incrementally by considering the behaviour of drivers in specific traffic scenarios.
The formality of the rule language not only ensures that driver behaviour can be specified and communicated clearly between the partners, but also permits rules to be machine readable. The IMAURO project fully pursued this opportunity with the development of a software mechanism which reads and compiles the rules into code which can be integrated with the simulation submodels and which executes the specified behaviour when the specified traffic scenarios are simulated.

PACSIM simulates movements of packets of vehicles (groups of 1 to 30 vehicles with a coherent behaviour) over a network representing a small urban area. Such packets follow routes from their origin to their destination. These routes are updated, according to the combined impact of traffic events and information technology (RTI). Packets are not static entities but do merge and split all over the network. PACSIM plays a central role for computing a dynamic assignment over the entire network. The PACSIM model includes the following desirable features: a flexible network representation, a flexible and standardised behaviourial mechanism, a behaviourally coherent traffic metaphor, an explicit time reference, and an explicit model for information flow.
The PACSIM information model takes the form ofa network that features 3 main types of nodes: detectors, traffic information centres and information sockets. These 3 classes of information network nodes are themselves linked by communication lines whose reliability and delay can be parametrized. The detector's purpose is to monitor the status of the network and to detect any traffic event therein. Traffic information centres are nodes at which information on detected traffic events is centralized, screened and then distributed to other centres and information sockets. Information sockets model the various devices that are used to transmit information to network users (radio beacons and dedicated broadcastings, variable message signs, etc). They can be situated anywhere on the network.

Within the context of the integrated model for the analysis of urban route organisation (IMAURO), MICSIM presents a moving window in the urban network with an animated graphical representation of vehicle flow. A file describing a perceived network is transferred from PACSIM to MICSIM at the point microscopic simulation should be initiated. This file effectively describes a snapshot of the PACSIM simulation on a small section of the road network which MICSIM proceeds to simulate for a short duration. A similar snapshot file is sent back to the now frozen PACSIM when the MICSIM simulation is complete.
The MICSIM software managing the kinematics of car following and gap acceptance at junctions provide the bedrock of the microscopic simulation submodel. To model the influence of broadcast road transport informatics (RTI) information on the vehicles being simulated, MICSIM makes use of an identical behaviourial rule mechanism to that of PACSIM. This layer of software of higher priority is used to model the major decisions drivers may take to reroute when informed of obstacles along their preplanned route. Thus 3 major components of MICSIM can be identified: MICSIM initialisation, MICSIM basic vehicle kinematic management and the MICSIM/PACSIM behaviourial rule mechanism.
The IMAURO solution is based on rapid execution of behaviourial rules which are used to specify complex behaviourial that might result for specific vehicle types in specific road situations. For sake of consistency within the IMAURO system, MICSIM uses the same rule set as PACSIM, which interprets in the same manner. However, for use within MICSIM, the rules are compiled to invoke MICSIM functions. The only difference in interpretation of the rule language for MICSIM, is that the USER denotes an individual vehicle whereas it denotes a packet within PACSIM.

The function of TOPCOST is to compute speed flow concentration relationships, to produce the cost results, and to transfer them to other submodels by adequate interfaces. TOPCOST is constructed as a number of components, each component managing a travel cost of a particular type.
TOPCOST uses a continuous traffic stream model. The maximum capacity flow is based on the principles of the American highway capacity manual (HCM) adapted for Belgian urban conditions. For roundabouts a British model is used.
The fuel consumption component is a variant of one of the Australian ARFCOM models. It computes the total fuel consumption of a vehicle, as it cruises towards an intersection, decelerates to the stopline, idles, accelerates, and cruises away from the intersection.
The travel time component is directly computed as the sum of cruise time and all kinds of delay. Cruise time is defined by the quotient of link length and cruise speed, which itself is obtained from the SFC model.
The junction queuing component is based on a British unified Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) approach derived from probabilistic queuing theory.
The discrete events component are treated by the kinematic wave approach originally conceived for traffic applications by Lighthill and Whitham.
The accidents component provides a macroscopic measure of the main categories of accident costs, as far as the necessary calibration data are available.
The noise component involves only the noise emission. TOPCOST estimates a weighted noise index for each link, in the middle of the link.
The exhaust pollution component deals with 6 different pollutants, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, lead components and various particles.
The information cost component where road transport informatics (RTI) costs are to be payed for a service or equipment provided by a private or public company. There is room for testing the impact of 5 basic RTI techniques on cost functi ons used for route choice. The fares component simulates a cost charged by the public authorities, independently of some information service to the road user.
The factors proposed to identify the value the route selection determinants of the individual's travel behaviour and of society optimum behaviour are described. TOPCOST uses 28 elementary costs on link level, which have been grouped, using a common aggregation method, into 5 impedance or objective oriented subsets, to construct 5 aggregate link functions.

The data necessary for the integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) simulation models are topological and geometric data for the description of the urban road network of the selected city and real traffic data in different traffic situations for calibration purposes. Topological and geometrical data could be taken from existing maps and plans. A second part is based upon the observation of the road characteristics on site. This data includes the geometrical characteristics of the junctions and links of the network such as length, width, number of lanes, parking zones, priorities, bus stops, etc. Another part is the road equipment for traffic regulation, such as speed limits that apply, cycle time of traffic lights, possible movements at a junction, etc.
The traffic data needed to calibrate a dynamic model are the flow, the classification of the vehicles, the distribution of speeds and the concentration or occupancy. The data collection methodology must be able to give figures characterising the traffic situation in a given zone of the network. Therefore different types of sensors were needed, some of them being capable of being moved and installed rapidly. 2 major types of equipment were tested, inductive loops and video based traffic sensors. A comparison of the measurements with video camera and inductive loops was completed, using as a reference some visual observations, executed by BRRC people on the same sites. The camera and loop equipment are now capable of delivering traffic data with good precision. The database representing the traffic observed at a main entry node of the central part La Corbeille in Namur, during different periods of the year and in different traffic conditions, is available for further use.

The output of IMAURO will be an integrated tool with a modular structure consisting of: 
- a data acquisition module, 
- a model construction module, 
- a data base system module. 
The project's data acquisition phase will collect essential `real world' data from a specific test network containing 500 km of urban roads by using modern techniques such as video camera observations & automatic image analysis, mobile measuring stations as well as other more classical data collection techniques. The data will be used in simulation testing. 
In the model construction phase, a tool will be constructed which will integrate : 
- a dynamic macroscopic traffic assignment using a `node environment' and limited driver knowledge of the network status (TOPSORT), 
- a microscopic traffic simulation based on gap acceptance (MICSIM), 
- an advanced network oriented numerical optimization technique (PSN LNO). 
The techniques to be used in the macroscopic model will enable the simulation of RTI effects such as driver information systems, incident detection systems, route guidance techniques, road pricing and green waves. 
The structure of the microscopic model will allow simulation of the effects of RTI, such as distance warning, overtaking aids, urban variants of convoy driving involving synchronized acceleration/deceleration phases in relation to traffic lights and other effects. 
The above described dynamic traffic simulation model will not include dynamic demand forecasting or modal split models but will provide a mechanism for integration with such models, if they are developed by other DRIVE projects. 
Finally the database system will be provided (including a database management subsystem) and will be used to store and retrieve data used in the models and in the interaction with the measurement work in the field. A user interface and a software interface to demand modelling tools will also be developed.

The project linked four of Europe's leading optical, semiconductor and computer companies with a chemical company and five universities, and aimed towards the commercial exploitation in high-performance processors from the mid-1990s onwards.
The overall objective of OLIVES was to develop optical interconnections for use in advanced electronic computer and processor systems, that were expected to significantly improve performance compared with the electrical alternative. The project focused on the development, construction and assessment of a set of demonstrators which acted as test beds for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional optical interconnections. These demonstrators covered the application of optics to both clock and data distribution at the chip, board and interboard levels.
Significant advances were made in the enabling technologies of holography, silica on silicon waveguides, precision mounting of optical elements, optical Stark modulators, detector arrays, and receiver and driver arrays in emitter coupled logic (ECL) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). A first prototype based on the optical mastercard was constructed. Clear applications for the gallium arsenide on silicon technology in optical motherboards and optoelectronics CMOS were identified, and collaborative research and development established. The development of stable cross linked polymers for waveguides and modulators also opened up many new possibilities. Overall, it has become clear that the comparison of optical and electrical interconnects is very system specific and a scheme which offers no advantages in one system may be very advantageous in another, depending on the precise system requirements.
Results for the major demonstrators are as follows: the optimum fanout range for the chip level optical clock distribution (chip area to area demonstrator) network was found to lie between 10 and 100; the benefits of chip area to area interconnects were considered in the context of neural networks where simulations of a 1000-node system showed a potential performance gain of several hundred; the optical bus would be used for the interconnection of several nodes and shared store in a coarse grain multiprocessor mainframe co mputer; the full benefit of the mastercard interconnects in the context of real time processors is the reduction in the volume occupied by the interconnection medium.
Finally, studies of the potential applications for optics to back plane busses in large departmental servers and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches are initiated.
The project focused on the development, construction and assessment of a set of demonstrators which acted as test-beds for two- and three-dimensional optical interconnections. These demonstrators covered the application of optics to both clock and data distribution at the chip, board and inter-board levels. 

To provide the components required for these demonstrators a significant technological effort was made in the fields of holography, guided wave components, receiver circuitry and optical modulators. In addition, precision alignment and hybridisation techniques for both the mounting of the optoelectronic components and the registration of the boards themselves were developed. 

In view of the present state of the art in the monolithic integration of active optical components and silicon circuitry, hybrid optoelectronic integration was used throughout the demonstrator construction phase. However, monolithic integration may offer great potential advantages, and in parallel with the demonstrator development a study of the growth of III-V compounds on silicon was undertaken. In addition, a study of polymeric materials for optical modulators is being included, since these may offer significant advantages over alternative techniques.";;;;;BNR Europe Ltd;UK;"FORTH RESEARCH CENTER OF CRETE;CENTRO NACIONAL DE MICROELECTRONICA;Thomson CSF;GEC Plessey Semiconductors plc;Siemens AG;AKZO INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH;EIDGENOESSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE;Birkbeck College, University of London;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"EL;ES;FR;UK;DE;NL;CH;BE";

To satisfy the test objectives, thirty highly radioactive radiation sources were planned to be emplaced in six boreholes located in two test galleries at the 800-m-level in the Asse salt mine, for a testing period of 5 years. Because of licensing uncertainties the German Federal Government decided on December 3rd 1992 to stop all activities for the preparation of the test disposal immediately.
As a consequence of the early termination of the project the working programme 1992-1994 was revised. The new programme for 1993 and 1994 agreed to by the project partners includes a controlled shut-down of the heater tests in 1993 and a continuation of the laboratory activities until the end of 1994.
The heater tests consisted in emplacing two reference non-radioactive electrical heaters in-situ. The original programme comprised the estimation and observation of the thermal, mechanical and radiation-induced interaction between the rock salt and the electrical heaters and the radiation sources, respectively. Also a radioactive source handling system was developed and installed in the mine.
For a number of years research and development activities have been carried out in the Asse salt mine for the final disposal of high level radioactive waste (HAW) in salt formations. The heat producing waste has been simulated so far by means of electrical heaters and also cobalt-60 sources. In order to improve the final concept for HAW disposal in boreholes drilled into salt formations, the complete technical system of an underground repository is to be tested in a full scale test facility. For handling of the radioactive canisters and their emplacement into the boreholes, a system consisting of 6 transport and storage casks, 2 above ground and underground shuttle transport casks, an above ground transfer station, an underground transport vehicle, a disposal machine, and of a borehole slider will be tested. The scientific investigation programme is based on the estimation and in situ observation of the thermal, radiation induced, and mechanical interaction between the radioactive canisters and the rock salt.

Due to licensing uncertainties, the German Federaal Government decided to stop all activities for the preparation of the test disposal facility in 1992.
In preparation of the radioactive tests however, two nonradioactive electrical heater tests were started in 1988 and were continuously surveyed until August 1993 in resoect of the thermomechanical and geochemical response of the rock mass.

This can be reached by the regular (annual) workshops in which the participants exchange their knowledge and experience in the results of the evaluation studies and by the visits to the centres during these workshops. 
A database on medical devices, to be used in the European member countries has been developed. The structure developed enables the users to introduce and present data on makes, models, most important properties, local standards, local regulations, a short description, hazards, alerts, literature, etc. Procedures to gather the data in a concerted action with experts form other member countries have been agreed. By using this program considerable time can be saved compared with local,individual activities on the setting up of a national database on medical devices in the member countries. The contents and structure of the database can easily be modified to fulfil the requirements of the users, hospital staff, suppliers, governmental or European organizations. Evaluation reports and quality guidelines have been distributed and made accessible in all the member countries. Procedures and protocols have been exchanged to enable the institutions to use the same methods in testing and evaluating equipment. The methods are used in comparative studies, acceptance testing or even in maintenance programs in hospitals. The database has been adapted to store data from the European directives on medical equipment for use in member countries.
The second aim is the distribution of information concerning these activities by means of the regular publication of a list of all reports on evaluations and market reviews of the member states. 

The third aim is to achieve mutual agreement on evaluation protocols. This can be achieved either by agreement on the use of IEC or ISO standards or drafts or by the listing of specific protocols for a particular device category by experts in this field invited by the participants. Such protocols could contribute to new publications of the international standardization bodies. 

The fourth aim is to build up a European database on medical equipment. This database will be developed and set up by the experts in some member countries and will be accessible for all EC-countries.

industrial effluents. To date the science of photocatalysis has received widespread attention whereas the development of the technologies for its application to solve environmental problems have been virtually neglected. 

While the method proposed will not be capable of dealing with very high levels of contamination by itself, it will possess the capability of handling low/medium levels of contamination, and in conjunction with already extant conventional technologies it will reduce the levels of pollution to much lower values than would be possible otherwise. 

The present proposal has the combined objectives of modelling, designing, constructing and testing a small-scale fluidised-bed photocatalytic reactor capable of handling contaminated 
industrial effluent at a volume capacity of 5m3.hr-1, with the alternative use of either artificial (u.v. lamp) and/or natural (solar) sources of electromagnetic radiation (reactor 
engineering). This will be done in conjunction with the 
development of photocatalytically active solids possessing 
optimum intrinsic activity and physical characteristics that are consistent with the fluido-dynamic requirements of the 
reactor (particle engineering/technology). 

The proposers bring a wealth of expertise to bear upon each of the distinctive aspects of the problem; namely, the modelling of the photo-reactor, their design, construction and testing, and the development of the photocatalysts. 

The technology developed from the project will be easily 
transferrable to a pilot or demonstration project operating in a closed-cycle or open-cycle mode by a wide range of industries for which the use of water is essential. The advances made will lead to a safer environment through the reduction of pollution levels and to a reduction in the quantity of effluent by 
increasing the number of cycles over which a given quantity of water can be used effectively within manufacturing industry with obvious economic advantages.";;;;CSC;University of Bradford;UK;"CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS;University of Bath;UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI PALERMO";"ES;UK;IT";

An environment for developing intelligent natural language interfaces to interactive computing environments (both information seeking dialogue systems and problem solving environments) has been developed. A first demonstrator, interactive Yellow Pages, was developed; the modular architecture incorporates a replaceable application model, enabling new applications to be produced with relatively little effort. 

Currently available languages are English and French. The emphasis on pragmatics and language independent reasoning, and the resulting simplicity and modularity of the language specific knowledge bases, facilitates the adaptation of the system to new languages or multilingual use.
Since the intention of a human user of natural language is to convey a message, and since all messages occur in some context, it is crucially important to exploit this context in the derivation of the intended interpretation. This contrasts with other approaches to the problem of robustness, which miss the heart of the problem, which is to react appropriately in a context created or updated by the fact that a user has typed something at a keyboard with the express purpose of communicating a message. 

One key issue is the exploitation of both pragmatic and linguistic phenomena (such as interpretation with respect to context) in order to provide reasoning-based robustness in natural language understanding by integrating these two areas.";;;;;CAP Gemini Innovation;FR;"KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT BRABANT;University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST);University of Bristol;Scientific Control Systems Informationstechnik Gmbh;UNIVERSITY OF GOTEBORG-THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF PRODUCTION ENGINEERING (IVF);Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS);Omega Generation Srl";"NL;UK;DE;SE;FR;IT";

The proposed project has direct applicability to wide application areas which include computer-integrated manufacturing, office systems, integrated information, processing systems and process control systems.
The Delta-4 architecture features original fault concepts for the development and design of dependable open distributed computing systems. To tackle the complex dependability validation task, a comprehensive strategy incorporating both objectives of the validation process (fault removal and fault forecasting) has been followed that is based on the use of complementary validation methods. The methods considered include formal verification of the design of twospecific reliable communication protocols, experimental validation of the implementation of the fault tolerance mechanisms by means of physical fault injection and analytical modeling and evaluation of hardware and software. The paper summarixes the main characteristics (objectives, implementation and results) for each of the methods applied in this validation strategy.

The aim of open systems interconnection was to formulate, develop and demonstrate an open, fault tolerant distributed system architecture.
As an open system, Delta-4 has 3 important properties:
implementations based on off the shelf heterogeneous computer systems are possible (the fault tolerant properties of the architecture are in no way dependent on the use of proprietary, fail safe or self checking processors);
the architecture conforms to the open system interconnection (OSI) model and implementation are able to coexist with and interwork with systems communicating by the use of current standard International Standardization Organization (ISO) OSI protocols;
the dependability and distribution properties of the architecture are offered in a transparent way to the user (both incremental dependability and incremental performance are offered on a service by service basis).

The proposal has both a generic component and an implementation component. The generic component contributes to basic concepts in the areas of dependability, multipoint communications, system administration and open distributed processing. The implementation component serves to demonstrate the validity of the concepts; the use of an experimental site and pilot sites is intended to enable their correctness to be established.

An open workshop presented a number of demonstrations, including the remote banking facility implemented in the DELTA-4 technology. The workshop also demonstrated, at system level, the effectiveness of the cloning of data and processes in achieving a dependable system. Results have been obtained in the area of system security based on fragmentation and scattering supported by DELTA-4 distributed technology.
More work is required on the real time and performance aspects of this advance in distributed systems.

8212;3148;DEMON;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Design Methods Based on Nets;19/06/1989;18/03/1992;;"The main aim of the DEMON Action was to enhance Petri-net theory and lay the foundations needed for a complete and effective design calculus for concurrent systems, to include: 
-composition, refinement and abstraction techniques 
-algebras and proof rules 
-notions of equivalence, congruence, simulation and implementation 
-associated formal verification techniques such as structural analysis or state-space analysis. 
The theoretical enhancements will support modular system construction and the refinement of high-level designs. In this way, the existing frequent use of Petri-nets as a graphical and analytical tool in the early stages of the design of individual parts of concurrent systems can be extended to include and integrate formal methods for all stages and aspects of the specification, construction and analysis of concurrent systems.
In order to ensure the correct and efficient functioning of concurrent systems, effective formal reasoning is indispensable during their design. Suitable formalizms should provide appropriate means to facilitate such reasoning. Petri net theory provides a mature formalizm capable of describing concurrency. The research undertook the foundation work needed for the eventual development of an effective design calculus for concurrent systems based on this formalizm. The envisaged calculus comprises structuring techniques, proof techniques, appropriate notions of equivalence and implementation, and analysis techniques.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach involved research directly concerning the appropriate net theoretical notions, in particular relating to modularity, and their interplay with concurrency semantics. 
This research was complemented by: 
-An attempt to combine the advantages of Petri-net theory with those of other approaches to concurrency theory that are more strongly compositionally oriented. 
-An attempt to bridge the wide gap between existing formal methods and the actual design of large concurrent systems. 
In this way the Action examined and strengthened the existing (and already rather tight) links between the Petri-net model and other models of concurrency. Furthermore, a selection of specification and implementation methods that are in actual use were investigated. 
To round off the work, a number of case-studies were investigated to test the usefulness of the approach. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Foundational work: DEMON has contributed to the development of a unified semantics of concurrency. In particular, strong relationships between transition systems and elementary Petri Nets have been detected. Trace theory has been generalised for Petri N ets and has been extended for the infinite case. 
-Analysis techniques: The relationship between structure and behaviour has been extensively studied. As a result, fast algorithms have been developed to check properties such as deadlock-freeness or reachability. Most recently, fast model checking algori thms have been developed and proved. 
-Calculus: A Petri net based algebra has been defined featuring action refinement, general recursion, priorities and other operators. A corresponding semantic domain using a restricted version of high level nets has been defined, and a fully compositiona l semantics given. The algebra features multilabels, by which multiway communications can be built up gradually, allowing atomic actions and shared data as well as channel communication to be handled compositionally. Its operational and denotational semantics have been given, and several case studies have been done. A large subset of occam-2 has been given a Petri net semantics using the calculus. 
-Structuring and equivalences: Results on property preservation can be divided into two groups: equivalence preservation (ie two coarse models with the same behaviour are expected to have the same behaviour after refinement in the same way) and behaviour preservation (ie the coarse and the refined systems model are expected to have the same behaviour). 
-Specification: A general class of high-level Petri nets which allow the syntactic manipulation of properties (algebraic nets) has been defined. Its use for the specification and the proof of case studies has been demonstrated; the case studies include f ully symmetric distributed termination and a general mutual exclusion algorithm. Algebraic nets have been linked to object oriented languages such as OBJ, and given a distributed semantics. 
-Proof techniques: A UNITY-style logics based on partial orders is under construction for algebraic nets. The calculus is being provided with inference rules, the usefulness of which has been demonstrated in the proof of a triply modular redundancy syste m. 
POTENTIAL 
The development of a new concurrent programming notation with traditional syntax and Petri net semantics is within reach. Forging existing Petri net tools (for instance, concerning state-space reduction) to fit a package including this language or occam is possible. 
The development of a modular design and verification package and the standardisation of the formal concurrency semantics of occam-2 can be envisaged as spin-off projects.

development of an advisory consultant for the system (this allows users unfamiliar with machine learning to incorporate the technology in their applications);

Envisaged products, in these areas, require technology with improved speed, reduced power consumption, increased packing density and good analogue performance.

In TIPBASE preproduction technology has been developed with a superior packing density and a speed and low power performance, which is at least a factor of 2 better than typical production technology. This technology is required for envisaged applications in telecommunications and consumer electronics. Also, advanced device research is performed in TIPBASE.

The goal of the project is to develop and fully integrate technology expertise design and computer aided design (CAD) achievements in the deep submicron range. The target specifications for the process are:
emitter width (minimum) 0.5 micron;
gate delay 30 pS;
power delay product 25 fJ;
number of interconnection layers 3;
via pitch (minimum) 3.5;
cut off frequency (maximum) 25 GHz.

The complete process has been integrated and demonstrators and prototype circuits have been fabricated and evaluated in order to demonstrate the performances of the processes, notably for applications in the field of consumer and telecommunications electronics, fast data and signal processing, and high speed application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). These are common performance demonstrators to prove the achievement of the overall technical goals, and include common test structures, standard ring oscillators, yield capability for 100 K level, and a standard frequency divider, in addition to the following branch specific demonstration circuits: 10 K mixed analogue/digital array for 10 Gbit/s systems, 8 bit 350 MHz analogue to digital conversion (ADC), 14 to 20 Gbit/s multiplexor (MUX), 8 to 10 Gbit/s laser driver, amplifier plus prescaler input stage, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) 2.5 Gbit/s 16:1 multiplexor MUX DEMUX, a radio amplifier/mixer for mobiles, and a direct waveform synthesizer (with 1.6 GHz clock) producing sine, square and triangular waveforms up to 400 MHz. Silicon/silicon germanium epitaxial layers were grown at low temperature. The first results show that this method is close to being a production technique. The properties of these layers make them appropriate for integration in heterobipolar transistors.
The target specifications after three years are: 

Process and specifications characteristics: emitter width (minimum) 0.5 micron, gate delay 30 pS, power delay product 25 fJ, no. of interconnection layers 3, via pitch (minimum) 3.5, cut-off frequency (maximum) 25 GHz 

For comparison, at the beginning of the project pilot production processes worldwide and also at the partners were characterised by 1 to 1.5 micron emitter widths, around 80 to 100 ps gate delays, 3 interconnect layers at around 5 micron minimum via pitch, and maximum complexities of up to 40 000 transistor functions. 

Very high speed bipolar technology fills a very important area between the lower performance but higher complexity per chip provided by MOS technology, and the extreme device speed but lower complexity per chip, higher cost per function, and limited availability of gallium arsenide. Bipolar technology is most suitable for high precision, high complexity and high-speed future information technology systems because its analogue features are best, its intrinsic speed is excellent, its transconductance (driving capability) is best, and availability as well as future perspectives are excellent. Higher data-processing rates, broader bandwidth communication and increased use of digital signal-processing techniques all demand the use of advanced bipolar technology.";;;;;PHILIPS GLOEILAMPENFABRIEKEN NV;NL;"Telefunken Microelectronic GmbH;GEC Plessey Semiconductors plc;SGS THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS SA;Technische Hochschule Darmstadt;Siemens AG;Università degli Studi di Catania;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT WIEN-IAIS;Technische Universität Berlin;University of Dublin;National Technical University of Athens;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT;Defence Research Agency (DRA);Thomson Microelectronics Srl (SGS);NATIONAL MICROELECTRONICS RESEARCH CENTRE;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"DE;UK;FR;IT;AT;IE;EL;NL;BE";

The following tasks were carried out:
analysis of the potential use of modern information technology (IT), including user interface, communications and linguistic tools;
establishment of a firm basis for future projects in these areas.

The result of the action was a clearer and more detailed picture of the requirements of these market sectors, the present status of the technology, and areas where improvements are possible.

State-of-the-art circuits for IT systems were to be produced using those devices exhibiting the greatest performance potential and suitability for integration. GaInAs-based material structures were investigated because of their considerably superior transport properties compared to conventional GaAs structures (eg higher electron mobility and higher electron saturation velocity). These advantages are expected to lead to a new generation of high-speed devices and circuits.
The device types initially chosen for investigation were pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors (HEMT), lattice matched HEMTs, barrier enhanced metal semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFET), and pseudomorphic semiconductor insulator semiconductor field effect transistors (SISFET). Both metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) epitaxial growth techniques are being used to produce high quality material for device fabrication. These growth processes are being optimised in the light of device results.

The best of these devices have now been selected for the initial development of integrated circuit technologies, which will be demonstrated by the design and fabrication of example integrated circuits (IC).

The project aimed to examine the high speed performance of a number of gallium indium arsenic novel transistors. State of the art circuits for information technology (IT) systems were to be produced using those devices exhibiting the greatest performance potential and suitability for integration.

The device types chosen for investigations were:
pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) (gallium indium arsenic channels grown strained on gallium arsenic substrates);
lattice matched HEMTs (aluminium indium arsenic barriers and gallium indium arsenic channels grown lattice matched on indium phosphorus substrates);
gallium indium arsenic junction field effect transistors (JFET);
pseudomorphic gallium indium arsenic channel semiconductor insulator semiconductor field effect transistors (SISFET) on gallium arsenic or indium phosphorous substrates;
barrier enhanced field effect transisitors (FET) and gallium indium arsenic.

Examples of novel gallium indium arsenic transistors have been produced with microwave performances approaching world records. These devices were compared at a later stage for their use in the project's final demonstrators:
a broadband 30 GHz amplifier;
a 1 to 2 GHz pulse regenerator circuit;
a 30 GHz divider;
inverter and ring oscillator circuits.

The project was completed successfully with all the demonstrators established. These could later form the basis of the building blocks for specific information technology (IT) subsystems.

The project focused on four main objectives: 

- the design of new high-performance transport service and protocol 
- the creation of new work items on high-speed protocols within ISO and the promotion of new transport protocol and service in international standardisation organisations 
- the study of the way the B-ISDN will fit into the OSI reference model, and of the resulting new services 
- the study of the requirements coming from the new computing environment (multimedia, ODP, distributed systems) on the transport service.
The four major goals achieved were: 
specification of high performance transport services and protocol (called TPX) and introduction in ISO; 
creation of the 'new work items' on high speed lower layers protocols in ISO; 
definition of the requirements for transport services coming from distributed and multimedia applications; 
definition of services offered by new broadband lower layers technologies, in particular broadband integrated services digital network (ISDN) based on asynchronous transmission (ATM). 

In addition to these results, and supporting them, the following activities were performed: 
analysis of adequacy of existing protocols to high speed communications, in particular evaluation of xpress transfer protocol (XTP); 
implementation of a hardware ATM interface; 
definition of guidelines for transport protocols very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation; 
study of a methodology of design using LOTOS; 
definition of a LOTOS extension for supporting time constraints; 
study of applicability of existing higher layer protocol.
The existing OSI protocols were defined in a technological environment where communication lines had low bandwidth and poor quality. The emergence of new communication techniques such as high speed LANs and MANs and broadband-ISDN has dramatically changed this situation. The potential bandwidth offered by these new communication environments is jeopardised by the existing OSI protocols of layers 3 to 7. 

Furthermore, the application environment is changing with the introduction of the multimedia, the new distributed applications and the ODP concept. New requirements are coming from these new application areas and the existing OSI lower layers protocols and services do not provide all services needed to meet these requirements.";;;;;Bull SA;FR;"ALCATEL AUSTRIA - ELIN;BELL TELEPHONE MANUFACTURING;FUNDACION GENERAL DE LA UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID - DIT/UPM;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;Olivetti Research Ltd;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;INTRACOM SA-HELLENIC TELECOM.& ELECTR.INDUSTRY;Institut National des Télécommunications";"AT;BE;ES;UK;FR;EL";

8227;1662;ECOLES;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Development of Representation for Machine Learning from Imperfect Information;01/11/1989;30/04/1992;;"The ECOLES Action studied the question of how to acquire knowledge and then maintain it within computer systems. Particularly in control tasks, the intuitive nature of human know-how presents a seemingly insuperable barrier to knowledge acquisition. By constructing systems able to learn from various data sources, machine learning aims to overcome the knowledge acquisition problems encountered in current software technology. In particular, the automatic construction of new representations is a main objective of this Action, as state-of-the-art methods in machine learning are critically limited by the representation of given problems. .
Fundamental problems in machine learning are being studied with the aim of developing logic based machine learning techniques that will enable the repair of knowledge bases that are incomplete, incorrect or ineffective.

Inductive logic programming has been fostered. The field has a strong theoretical foundation inherited from logic programming together with an experimental orientation from machine learning. The GOLEM inductive system has been tested on hard problems, including multiagent environments, qualitative modelling problems, protein folding application and noisy data.

Research has been carried out in the following areas:
architecture for multiagents learing (a new scheme for knowledge integration and a new architecture based on Candidate Theory;
incremental learning (rule revision by an incremental learning scheme);
knowledge modules (a method based on correctness and coverage allowing better knowledge integration);
learning problem solver heuristics (the aim being to generate heuristics for a problem solver defined by a terminal condition, a state space and a set of operators);
conceptual clustering techniques (conceptual graphs improve learning in CHARADE and background knowledge and saturation methods are used);
Metaclauses (compilation of control expressed as metaclauses in the YAM, a meta interpreter system on SOARLOG);
learning qualitative models of dynamic systems;
relational descriptions (inductive learning of relational description from noisy examples);
learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases (results obtained use the induction learning system LINUS, incorporate ASSISTANT and implement background knowledge provided by medical specialists).
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The approach taken in this Action has been to develop logic-based machine learning techniques that will enable the repair of knowledge-bases and databases that are either: 
-ineffective, such that certain questions can in theory be answered correctly, but the derivation of these answers is intractable within the given computational resources 
-incomplete, in that there exist questions whose answers are not derivable given the present state of knowledge 
-incorrect, in that certain questions are answered incorrectly given the present state of knowledge. 
Solving these problems will lead to the identification and evaluation of principles, methods and topologies that can be used in applications. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Inductive logic programming has been fostered. The field has a strong theoretical foundation inherited from logic programming together with an experimental orientation from machine learning. The Golem. inductive system has been tested on hard problems,including multi-agent environments, qualitative modelling problems, protein folding application, and noisy data. 
-Architecture for multi-agents learning. A new scheme for knowledge integration and a new architecture based on 'Candidate Theory' are being investigated. 
-Incremental learning. Rule revision by incremental learning scheme has been developed and tested. Rules that have returned to an agent (when new data reveal that these are sufficiently relevant) are accompanied by a set of relevant cases that help the a gent in the process of revision. 
-Knowledge modules. A method based on correctness and coverage is being investigated to allow better knowledge integration. 
-Learning problem-solver heuristics. The aim is to generate heuristics for a problem-solver defined by a terminal condition, a state space and a set of operators. The results obtained are encouraging and tests are being carried out on one player games of slide and jump and the Hanoi tower. 
-Conceptual clustering techniques. Conceptual graphs are used to improve learning in CHARADE. Background knowledge and saturation methods are used. The construction of ordering structure has been shown to be fully incremental and the cost introducing new examples is linear with the number of descriptors it contains. 
-Meta-clauses. Compilation of control expressed as meta clauses in the YAM (a meta interpreter) system on SOARLOG is complete. Efficiency of the interpreter has been achieved by introducing control predicates such as freeze and cut. YAM uses transformati on techniques avoiding the necessary use of preference clauses. 
-Learning qualitative models of dynamic systems. The QSIM formalism is used as a representation for learned qualitative models. The problem of learning QSIM-type models is formulated in logic, and the GOLEM learning program used for induction. 
-Relational descriptions. Inductive learning of relational description from noisy examples has been investigated. LINUS and FOIL have been extended to learning restricted Horn clauses with negation. Their performance is measured on a problem of using ill egal position in a chess end game. Both systems performed well. 
-Learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. Results obtained using the induction learning system LINUS, incorporating ASSISTANT, using background knowledge provided by medical specialists have shown that the approach is very effective in h andling noise.

The specification of requirements, which describes functional and non-functional properties of the system and of its environment, can be distinguished from the specification of the design, which describes the system alone for the benefit of software engineers. 

The ICARUS project is concerned with the study of formal methods for building requirements specifications. 
A wide spectrum requirement engineering (RE) language has been defined and coupled with a process description mechanism. The requirements engineering language is a formal specification language making it possible to express requirements in a natural operational and/or declarative style, to structure large requirements documents and to apply consistency and completeness checks on possibly incomplete specifications. The process description technique is based on a concept of workplan describing the planning and the organization of the tasks already done and/or to be achieved. A prototype environment has been developed actively to support their use. This environment is based on a process driven RE assistant integrating active analyst guidance, consistency and completeness checking, and specification visualization. A qualitative assessment of the formal concepts and tools developed has been achieved by performing case studies on selected families of real world applications.
Three levels of analysis have been identified in the study of such methods: the specification product (the description of the desired system in its environment); the specification process (the set of activities by which the specification is produced); and the specification rationale (the set of reasons that have led to the choice of a particular process).";;;;;SEMA GROUP BELGIUM SA;BE;"REALACE LTD;ALCATEL SESA;Alcatel Alsthom Recherche;DECISION SYSTEMS;PHILIPS SA;FACULTES UNIVERSITAIRES NOTRE-DAME DE LA PAIX;Sema Group SA;Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA;UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA";"IE;ES;FR;BE";

Its method of doing this is by testing the strengths and limitations of current standard representations for qualitative reasoning about processes, and by identifying new paradigms that will encourage new types of applications. It has been set up to promote qualitative reasoning as a technique in Europe by organisingopen workshops and at least one technology transfer meeting to which representatives of European projects that could benefit from the use of qualitative reasoning methods can be invited. .
The project brought together the most active centres of research in qualitative reasoning in Europe in order to define the subject and to extend the range of problems to which qualitative reasoning can be applied. The collaboration has concentrated on six issues: systems with distributed parameters, reasoning about time, spatial reasoning, the drawing of qualitative conclusions from mathematical information, the use of multiple models or views of phenomenon, and intelligent automation. Developments in this work have led to a further concentration on the use of qualitative reasoning in design, particularly where problems are not specified primarily by equations.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Each topic covered requires a specific approach: 
-Distributed parameters: modelling a distributed system by a collection of elements behaving as molecule-like units. Division of multidimensional spaces into qualitatively equivalent regions after identifying the conditions expressing qualitative equival ence. 
-Temporal reasoning: comparative assessment of different interval-based logic systems and qualitative calculi, in order to select the best ones for capturing common-sense views of durations, extended events and processes. 
-Spatial reasoning: development of the technical concept of 'place vocabulary' to handle examples of 2-dimensional physical objects with arbitrary 2-dimensional motions. 
-Mathematical information: construction of a taxonomy of equation sets and types, and of representations suitable for holding expert knowledge about the interpretation of equations. 
-Multiple models: development of description mechanisms that can be used to indicate when it is appropriate to use each type of model. 
-Intelligent automation: defining benchmark problems that are realistic in themselves and that also provide reasonable tests of each of the schemes mentioned above. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
While the Working Group's members have made technical progress on each of the six topics that it originally undertook to study, the main results of its efforts have been: 
-The establishment of active links with the qualitative reasoning community and research programmes in North America, to the extent that its continuing contribution to the evolution of qualitative reasoning is recognised as being of world standard. 
-A change of focus from the symbolic (algebraic) mathematical style of expressing and solving problems to an approach that takes into account more general frameworks for human qualitative judgements. 
A consequence of the latter is that qualitative reasoning is now tackling new types of problems, particularly in design (architectural, electronic, etc), which are not specified primarily by equations. Because of this, the subject is returning to the emphasis that it had when it began in the early 1970s: 'naive physics', or reasoning about behaviour of systems and structures by using informal or everyday terms and axioms to describe them. The Working Group's existence has ensured that this has been an international and not just an American development. 
Three types of workshops/conferences have been run by the Group. General European meetings have been organised for researchers and users of qualitative reasoning (Genoa 1991). Technical workshops on individual topics were arranged (eg. distributed parameters, multiple models of single phenomena). Finally, international workshops have attracted significant American and Japanese participation (1990, 1992). Activities and collaborations such as these will be continuing. 
It is now appreciated that the full scope of qualitative reasoning requires more of a connection with research and development in mainstream topics in knowledge-based systems than existed in the 1980s. Part of this appreciation has come from the experiences of the Group's members. In particular, qualitative knowledge needs many of the same approaches and results as are used in the general subject of knowledge representation. Hence integration of existing technical achievements of qualitative reasoning with such approaches has become the agenda for the near future. This is a two-way process: it is generally appreciated that software and techniques developed in research by participants in the Group, among others, can extend the usefulness of mainstream knowledge-based systems. This has proved to be relevant not only as a research issue, but also for the extended applicability of knowledge-based systems in commercial and industrial environments. 
POTENTIAL 
The main potential of the Group's work is seen as being the extension of qualitative reasoning as a subject: its boundaries are still fluid. For exploitation in applications, existing work (particularly in spatio-temporal modelling) is suitable for early use. In Europe, it simply needs wider awareness among possible users.";;;;;University College London;UK;"ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE DE LAUSANNE;Siemens AG;Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG);Heriot-Watt University;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI MILANO";"CH;DE;UK;IT";

The aim of the project is to improve the efficiencywith which knowledge is acquired at all phases of knowledge based system (KBS) development.
The objective is to construct a knowledge engineering workbench (KEW) that will provide an integrated environment for knowledge elicitation and acquisition. Acquisition techniques will be integrated involving exisiting automated and nonautomated techniques. The key constituents of this workbench are machine learning, knowledge elicitation and dialogue techniques. Learning mechanisms will support automatic deduction and organization of new knowledge after new information has been provided or a particular event oberved. Elicitation methods will be implemented that will define the protocols of interaction with the system. Mixed initiative dialogue techniques, based on the recognition of intentions and the visualization of knowledge bases, will provide the foundations for integrating learning mechanisms and elicitation methods in the same environment. The project will also develop a comprehensive framework for guidance at all stages in KBS development.

A first experimental prototype, integrating knowledge acquisition tools for diagnosis and classification applications, has been built and demonstrated, and following evaluation and experiments, a fully integrated version of the workbench has been designed and implemented. Feedback from evaluation, experiments and application developments has been incorporated in the final version of KEW. The workbench includes various knowledge acquisition tools, knowledge storage facilities, knowledge transformation tools, advice and guidance for application developers and user interface libraries.
The objective is to construct a Knowledge Engineering Workbench (KEW) that will provide an integrated environment for knowledge elicitation and acquisition. Methods for integrating several knowledge acquisition techniques will be developed, and an environment that integrates a number of existing automated and non-automated techniques constructed.

This research describes a modelling method and language for process models during the system life cycle. Open system architecture for computer integrated manufacturing (CIM-OSA) supports model engineering and model execution for operation monitoring and operation control.
A prototype was made available on 12/31/93
This CIM-OSA primary release will encompass the features essential for the support of enterprise-wide information use. The migration of existing applications will also be supported, and users will be able to implement CIM-OSA-based information systems. Validation of this primary set of functional specifications will be achieved through the use of prototypes and via the real operation of the relevant parts of CIM-OSA. Emphasis will be on business integration in the areas of product development, product planning and manufacturing. The integrating infrastructure will build on and use the upper layers of the ISO's OSI model. 

The promotion of CIM-OSA in standardisation will be undertaken. Standards proposals based upon CIM-OSA modelling and integrated infrastructure frameworks will also be submitted to the relevant organisations. 

The promotional aspects that began in the foundation project 688 (AMICE) will be continued and expanded.

A prototype charge coupled device (CCD) colour camera has been developed for still photography applications in desk toppublishing and the graphic arts. The camera uses a single megapixel CCD imager with a unique colour filter mask and image microscanner module to achieve programmable resolution of up to 3000 by 3000 colour pixels. The use of multilayer dielectric filters in very high fidelity colorimetry. A specially designed lens accommodates a wide range of image formats and houses the microscanner module. Fully digital colour processor electronics are used to produce the colour image data with high signal to noise ratio, excellent reproducibility and high colorimetric accuracy.

The ODT program provided a broad field of information about the state of art of optronics. It appears that the selection of an optimum architecture is very difficult for a general hypothetical system. The design guidelines established during ODT program could be efficiently applied once a system was precisely defined. 
This program has identified open problems which are mainly due to the weak experience of optic in avionics. The results about the feasibility of optical systems allow optimism about the maturity of the optical technology. 
Good experience was gained with the practical aspects of fibre optics concerning handling with, and installation in, aircraft. 
The flight test demonstration showed good functioning (error free) of optical data transmission in aircraft environment. 
A lot of useful experience was gained during the whole project, in working together with the team of European partners. 

The number of data required by the on board systems increases rapidly (doubles every 3 to 4 years), the network complexity grows, at the same time stronger real time requirements take place. Therefore high data transmission speed and shorter access time will be inevitable. The answer to this challenge is the introduction of optical data transmission networks in the next generation of aircraft. Wide bandwidth, very high immunity against electromagnetic interference (EMI), perfect disconnection of electrical potential and low weight are outstanding properties of optical fibre.
After determination of the characteristics of existing and envisaged sensors, processors and terminals, data rate requirements, system topologies and protocols will be derived. Furthermore available hardware will be assessed, needs for improvement identified and standardization at the European level will be initiated with the aim of more efficient component development and enhanced competitiveness of European suppliers. On this basis implementation guidelines for optical data bus systems will be issued and test methods for components and systems for production as well as for operational systems will be specified.

8673;2267;ISA;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Integrated Systems Architecture for ODP;01/03/1989;28/02/1993;;"End-users are increasingly indicating a need to move away from a single-vendor central IT system policy and towards multi-supplier distributed systems. This growing market trend offers an opportunity to turn the fragmentation of the European IT industry into a strength by developing a standard generic architecture for such systems, enabling integration and interworking of applications from a wide variety of domains using heterogeneous equipment from multiple vendors. 

The existence of an architectural platform for distributed systems will create important opportunities for European suppliers. It can be exploited not only by the major product-supply companies but also by skilled niche-suppliers, enabling them to integrate their products into a wide variety of IT systems and facilitating their ability to produce integrated multi-supplier offerings. By leading in the development of the architecture important advantages are gained, such as an early ability to produce conformant systems. 

The ISA project has developed and demonstrated just such a generic architecture for Open Distributed Processing (ODP) in multi-vendor multi-domain heterogeneous systems. 

As systems become distributed, the future of IT lies in the ability to achieve integration of computing and telecommunications; the ISA consortium has been structured to include strong representation by companies in both sectors so that each may benefit from the experience and insights of the others, and so that the architecture may cater for the needs of both. 

ISA had three important themes: interworking, integration and standardisation. ISA will enable the integration of systems from multiple vendors by creating a set of common architectural constructs for distributed systems and by using these constructs in the development of standards. Achievement of integration has proved by practical demonstrations of heterogeneous applications interworking via the software platform. 

The objectives of the ISA project were to: 

- develop an architectural reference model for Open Distributed Processing that enable standards to be defined that are common to all application domains 
- stimulate the generation of, make contributions to and encourage the adoption of the necessary standards 
- demonstrate the practicality of integration and interworking using the architecture and associated standards 
- provide a focus of expertise in ODP.
The integrated systems architecture (ISA) project is developing and demonstrating a generic architecture for open distributed processing (ODP) in multivendor multidomain heterogeneous systems. As systems become distributed, the future of information technology (IT) lies in the ability to achieve integration of computing and telecommunications.

The objectives of the ISA project are to:
develop an architectural reference model for ODP that will define standards;
stimulate the generation of, make contributions to an encourage the adoption of the necessary standards;
demonstrate the practicality of integration and interworking using the architecture and associated standards;
provide a focus of expertise in ODP.

Different applications will require appropriate levels of functionality from the architecture and an ability to optimize it for a particular domain and emphasize suitable quality attributes. Multimedia aspects, both in distribution and computation, have a key role in ISA, as has the ability to scale upwards to multicountry distributed systems and the need for federated management.
The project focuses on the architecture, interfaces, platforms and standards and on transferring the technology into demonstrators within product development divisions in the partner companies. The major deliverables from the ISA project will be:
the architecture, known as ANSA;
manuals for reference, architecture design, programming and users;
standards for the architecture and ODP;
a software suite consisting of the architectural platform and the necessary tools;
demonstrations of key feautures of the architecture;
the transfer of the technology to the project partnrs and other projects.
The architecture places important emphasis upon 'evolution not revolution', so that existing systems may be encapsulated and incorporated; it must incorporate existing programming languages and many different operating systems and infrastructures while at the same time making proper provision for future developments. In order to provide a common focus the project has established a 'core laboratory' in Cambridge, where staff from partners' companies meet and work together. 

Different applications (for example, office, CIM, CAD, telecommunications, network management, corporate information systems) require appropriate levels of functionality from the architecture and an ability to optimise it for a particular domain and emphasise suitable quality attributes, such as response time, throughput, security and robustness. This requires an approach which pays careful attention, for example, to corporate goals and managerial issues, enabling their requirements to be described by means of viewpoints or projections of the architecture. Multi-media aspects, both in distribution and computation, have a key role in ISA, as has the ability to scale upwards to multi-country distributed systems and the need for federated management.

Specific Applications Support 

The architectural implications of applying the Home Systems Standard in practice will be investigated. Example applications being considered for study include such areas as security and safety, home working, and health care (including support of the elderly and disabled). 

Interworking with Other Standards 

This area will cover the interworking of the Home Systems standard with other OSI-type network system and home automation standards (D2B, Profibus, etc). 

Introduction of the Home Systems Standard to Standards Bodies 

The new standard will be introduced in CENELEC. 

In addition, the Home Systems consortium are preparing a parallel project, on their own initiative, independent of the ESPRIT programme. This project will handle the following additional workprogramme items: 

Home Systems Media Standards 

The new work will cover further study on plastic optical fibre, and possibly a fast infra-red medium. 

Conformance Testing 

Once the validated standard has been completed, conformance testing facilities have to be established to enable manufacturers to submit their equipment for testing for conformance to that standard. It is foreseen that these facilities will be set up under the responsibility of a new European Association for Home Systems. 

Human Interfaces

In previous tests, CACTUS 1 and CACTUS 2, particular care was taken to ensure accurate tracing of the clay response and reliable measurements. Peripheral instrumentation for each test included thermal probes (temperature), piezometric nests (pore water pressure), Glötzl cells (total stress), extensometers (strain) and a gamma-neutron probe (clay density and water content). 

This instrumentation enables the evolution of the principal physical parameters of the clay massif to be monitored closely throughout all tests, each of which had three phases corresponding to specific thermo-hydro-mechanical loads:

(1) Excavation of the borehole
(2) Installation of the heater and consolidation of the clay massif around the borehole
(3) Heating/cooling cycles 

The CACTUS tests constitute a rather unique and comprehensive experimental data base that facilitates the overall conduct of modelling from the isothermal phases through thermal cycling. Based on this, ANDRA set up two research teams, that started out with different approaches to the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of the saturated clays, particularly Boom clay, and with different modelling tools to conduct the CACTUS tests:

The system will be able to climb up and down staircases, turn on stair landings, locate and cross obstacles and avoid collisions, and it is to have an increased payload volume compared to any equivalent mono-body machine. Equipped with local sensors, locomotion and navigation controllers, and a powerful man-machine interface, the system offers to the operator reliable graphic assistance for full teleoperation.
A robust mobile, articulated multibody (4 modules) vehicle (MESSINA) is being developed which is suitable for nuclear plant indoor operations. 
Based on a study of the real demands of nuclear installations in Europe, the demonstrator's dimensions, degrees of freedom, and principles of movement and stair climbing have been decided; the design and fabrication phases are in progress. Documents specifying the locomotion controller (LC) software and hardware (using the Texas Instruments TMS 320C40) have been provided, and the LC control algorithms are in the testing phase on a 3-module mock up. Kinematic and dynamic simulations are about to be finalized. The navigation controller (NC), based on TELEMAN TM15 assistant navigation block (ANB) results, is mainly composed of a perception unit, a motion generator, an executive controller and man machine interface (MMI) software. The functional architecture of the NC and the hardware requirements have been decided upon. For the purpose of detecting and avoiding obstacles and perceiving the environment, appropriate ultrasonic sensors have been developed and selected. The specification of the MMI has been completed.
Exploitation
This project is exploiting results from the earlier TELEMAN projects TM15 - A.N.B on navigation control, TM14 - TALOS for the basic concept of the multi-body vehicle, and TM8 on kinematic and dynamic simulation and umbilical handling. The project still has some way to go before completion, so exploitation plans can not be detailed at this stage and will depend on final results. Nevertheless, the involvement of key potential users from different types of nuclear installations ensures the wide industrial relevance of the work.
Work to be done 

- Performance of a system design study considering the recommendations of the end users. The result will be the required technical specification for the 4-module demonstrator machine, including approval of the interfaces and a testing and operating plan. 
- Performance of comprehensive kinematic and dynamic simulations of the 2- and 4-module vehicles. 
- Development, fabrication and procurement of the key-components for the demonstrator vehicle: (a) undercarriages of the four modules, (b) vehicle segments with coupling elements, (c) umbilical management system, (d) locomotion controller, (e) navigation controller, (f) local perception sensors, (g) man-machine interface. 
- Integration of all pre-tested sub-systems on the MESSINA 4-module demonstrator 
- Final validation of the assembled MESSINA system in the laboratories 
- Field testing of MESSINA in a realistic test environment considering the recommendations of the end users 
- Production of test reports, video documentation of the test cases and suggestions for further development steps of a mobile system. 
- Complex motion generation for the multi-body mobile robot will be performed in collaboration with the Technical University of Lodz, Poland. 
In addition, final year student research projects will be carried out at the Universities of Pisa, KU Leuven, and the Politecnica of Madrid. 

Test strategy 

A full scale, 4-module demonstrator vehicle will be pre-tested and validated in the laboratories.

8250;3200;OLDS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Structure and Transport Properties of Organic Low-Dimensional Systems for Application to Information Technology;01/07/1989;31/03/1992;;"Microelectronics is developing and advancing by making the electron-transporting structures smaller through more sophisticated microfabrication. Molecular electronics seeks to take the smallest building block, the organic molecule, and assemble it into structures that can be used for information processing. 
This Action aimed to assemble electron-transporting molecules and molecules possessing dipole moments. The goal was to achieve molecular-scale information processing by the manipulation and control of charge motion or the orientation of molecular dipoles.
Organic molecule structures that can be used in molecular electronics were addressed. 2 kinds of organic molecules were studied: conjugated molecules (ie, those with electron transport properties) to be used for wiring, and lipid molecules (ie, with defined dipole moments) which can be used to represent information. The molecules were controlled and assembled by the Langmuir Blodgett (LB) technique into films. New knowledge about molecular scale information technology (IT) devices will be derived.

New phthallocyanine and bis-diacetylene molecules have been synthesized and characterized and new donor and conjugated wire acceptor moleculeshave been prepared and assembled as LB films. A new ladder polymer has been synthesised and is capable of acting as a superior molecular wire, as both parts of the ladder have to be simultaneously defective to block wire operation.
LB films of diacetylene polymers and new phthallocyanine molecules have been prepared.
Computer modelling of the LB film has been set up in 2 contrasting ways. The first is detailed molecular dynamics and the second models molecular groups as cellular automata.
An automated system to view dipolar moments by fluorescent labelling now exists. These are being studied in phospholipids.
A prototype now exists for a new scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and progress has been made on the related scanning near field optical microscope (SNOM), with the creation of a novel SNOM tip; plasma propagating on a fine wire to a tip convert to light on reaching the tip.
Photoelectrons have been timed in their transit across up to 48 molecular layers. Recently, insertion of 2 molecular blocking layers has been shown to stop the electron transit, ie, electron motion is manipulated on a molecular scale. Designs for memories in which electrons are shifted between layers, in a controlled manner, by electric fields or by light pulses, have been developed.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
-The molecules were assembled into films by the LB technique. 
-New organic molecules were synthesised. These were designed both for their electron-transporting properties and for their behaviour in LB film formation. 
-Techniques successful in surface chemistry (such as scanning electron microscopy, STM) were used to characterise the LB films produced. 
-Two techniques were used to structure the films and electrode systems: laser ablation and electron-beam lithography. 
-The motion of photo-electrons was studied on the picosecond time-scale. Dipolar domains were studied by optical techniques. 
Computer modelling was used to: 
-Model the intermolecular interactions and packing of the LB film structure. This aids the search for better molecules. 
-Study elemental information processing steps, and their collective behaviour, both for information as charge, and information as dipole orientation. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
New phthallocyanine and bis-diacetylene molecules have been synthesised. Inter-partner work on their characterisation has been conducted. New donor-conjugated wire-acceptor molecules have been prepared and assembled as LB films. A new ladder polymer has been synthesised. It is capable of acting as a superior molecular wire, as both parts of the ladder have to be simultaneously defective to block wire operation. 
LB films of diacetylene polymers have been prepared. Rapid electron motion on a polymer backbone in the plane of the film has been seen for the first time. These films have been used in work on ablative and electron beam lithographic patterning, with characterisation by ellipsometry and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy. 
LB films of the new phthallocyanine molecules have been prepared, characterised, and the interlayer electron tunnelling measured. The tunnel time is sub-nanosecond, and is related to designed molecular parameters. 
Computer modelling of the LB film has been set up in two contrasting ways. The first is by detailed molecular dynamics, staying close to molecular reality, and is consequently fairly limited along the time axis. The second models molecular groups as cellular automata, and can follow motion for a long time, but at the expense of accuracy. 
An automated system to view dipolar moments by fluorescent labelling now exists. These are being studied in phospholipids. 
Progress on the manufacture of a new STM has been good, and the first prototype now exists. In addition, considerable progress has been made on the related scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), with the creation of a novel SNOM tip; plasma propagating on a fine wire to a tip convert to light on reaching the tip. 
Photoelectrons have been timed in their transit across up to 48 molecular layers. Recently, insertion of 2 molecular blocking layers has been shown to stop the electron transit, ie, electron motion is manipulated on a molecular scale. 
Designs for memories in which electrons are shifted between layers, in a controlled manner, by electric fields or by light pulses, have been developed. 
POTENTIAL 
Charges on molecules, or the orientation of a molecular dipole, can be used to represent information. Information processing then requires manipulation and control of the motion of charge and dipole orientation. Information processing devices substantially smaller than those in conventional microelectronics can be foreseen.";;;;;Queen Mary and Westfield College;UK;"Università degli Studi di Genova;University of Dublin;UNIVERSITÄT TÜBINGEN;Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV;HELMUT HUND";"IT;IE;DE";

Technical Approach  

The project identifies needs for the application of emulation/simulation through cooperation with projects undertaking systems design.  The architecture of a generic emulation/simulation system has now been defined.  A review of available techniques will indicate those applicable to general and specific problems; the specific needs of the TMN will be used as a starting point for this.  

Prototypes for ATM network emulators/simulators will be developed, incorporating important functions of the IBC as required by selected projects.  These will be used to support the testing of TMN prototypes.  With suitable adaptation, the systems will also support the testing of prototypes from other areas of RACE, such as the Verification and CPN areas.  Continuous contacts with other interested RACE projects will lead to a revision of the emulation/simulation architecture used by the project.  

Key Issues  
The project addresses various ATM network issues in order to develop high performance emulation/ simulation systems.  The development of common interfaces with selected RACE projects will also be addressed.  

Achievements  
The identification of IBC areas which need emulation/simulation and a review of relevant existing techniques, methods and tools have been carried out. Work has started for the production of recommendations on the use of E/S in the testing of IBC.  

Following the first year of work, the consortium was in a position to offer for assessment a preliminary view of a proposed emulator/simulator hybrid system (ES).  

A review of all RACE projects led MIME to establish close cooperation with a number of RACE projects (R1005, R1082, and R1087).  

A general architecture of a parallel high performance transputer based system has been defined.  A number of prototype systems based on state of the art, high performance, transputer arrays has been produced.  MIME has defined the platform for the development of suitable ESH systems based on de-facto standards such as UNIX, X-Windows, and TCP/IP.  

The work has so far resulted in eleven published papers in international forums.  

Expected Impact  
Availability of emulators/simulators of IBC elements will promote validation techniques for the development of IBC components.  In addition, an early availability of emulators/simulators of IBC elements will support the testing of prototypes in RACE projects.  MIME is the only RACE project having as its primary goal, to produce ATM based simulators essential for the testing of conformance and performance of networks.";;;;;Alpha SA;EL;"UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM;KTAS;GSI-ERLI;Elektronik Centralen;IBM France SA";"UK;DK;FR";

PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
During the period of the initial 15-month contract, CABERNET has established effective mechanisms for the management, administration and coordination of the Network and has made progress in all four work areas (as outlined below). Through applications from interested research groups, including one new industrial member, the Network has expanded from 20 to 30 member nodes. 
Research Coordination: the research coordination committee has produced a report to i) a evaluate the 'state-of-play' of distributed systems research within CABERNET, and ii) act as an evolving inventory of relevant research projects so that CABERNET members are informed of each others activities. This report is over 140 pages long and covers over 100 different research projects. In March 1992 the committee organised the first plenary workshop of the Network, attended by 90 member representatives, providing opportunities for inter-disciplinary information exchange on the research work of member nodes and detailed discussions on the six areas of distributed computing systems research - algorithms, operating systems and kernels, programming support environments and languages, dependability, high speed networks and multimedia systems, and real-time systems. There have also been a number of short research exchanges sponsored by the committee. 
Research Training: The research training committee has co-sponsored the Lisboa 92 Advanced Course on Distributed Systems, aimed at familiarising both practitioners and researchers with key issues in distributed systems, and an InterAkief Study Tour on distributed systems and multimedia systems. A database of Network-wide research training activity is being collated and proposal to establish the CABERNET Research Training Institute has been submitted under the EC's Human Capital and Mobility Programme.Links to Industry: The links to industry committee has defined and is now implementing an Industrial Liaison Database for the use of CaberNet members to enable speedy dissemination of information to industry. CaberNet Industrial Affiliates Scheme has been established to allow less research-oriented groups or individuals from industry to become involved in the activities of CABERNET (receiving regular information about workshops, seminars and training activities organised by CABERNET member nodes, and enab ling  asy access to the latest CABERNET research results). Awareness of CABERNET in industry is being increased by the production and distribution of publicity material. Particularly emphasis is being placed on targeting appropriate research groups in industry with a view to their becoming members of CABERNET. 
Infrastructure Planning: the infrastructure planning committee has specified and is now implementing a UNIX-based fileserver infrastructure for the provision of a network-wide information sharing service. This service will be managed by a newly established infrastructure task force and will provide access to shared databases, technical reports and software libraries, and indeed all information produced by the network via distributed file systems such as Andrews File System and via file-transfer mechanisms such as ftp. A general directory service based on the CCITT X.500 protocol is being implemented for storage and retrieval of information on persons, documents and network objects. The committee has published a survey of infrastructure provision and requi rements across the three pilot Networks and is coordinating the specification of infrastructure requirements for all networks of excellence. Finally, an international registration of the ec.org domain has been acquired which can be used for naming purposes in all networking activities related to the CEC. Services to be offered based on the domain name service are under study by the relevant working group. A further three years funding has now been agreed for CABERNET and during this period the Network will build on the progress outlined above, with particular attention being given to publishing its activities and attracting industrial membership and affiliation.

The project focuses on the identification of new opportunities given by the use of integrated broadband communications (IBC) in the domain of computer aided design (CAD) computer aided manufacture (CAM) applications in the automotive industry in Europe.

At first the project concentrated on establishing an initial set of organisational and end user requirements and functional specification for the CAR application pilot. Next the initial application pilot design concentrated on the key areas of development:
high speed communications;
CAD/CAM applications;
multimedia services.
An experimental programme was set up based on this framework. The early phase of the pre-implemented work concentrated on the implementation of these experiments and reported on discussions about a common development platform. Then the project completed its design phase and its pre-implementation phase. Design work concentrated on the further detailed progression of individual experiments and their development into integrated prototypes. Pre-implementation of these initial designs was also completed. The experiments were further refined and more functionalities added. Usability evaluation criteria and functionality check-lists were developed. Each of the individual experiments was evaluated by experts. Existing and emerging technologies were investigated. The application model was progressed. A simulation system was developed in order to validate user requirements externally to the project.
Technical Approach  

The project will follow four phases to define, design, implement and evaluate the application pilot.  This will  pioneer a distributed CAD/CAM application with the ability to integrate the design team, manufacturing plants and parts suppliers into one distributed entity. The use of video/voice communication will be addressed, in addition to high speed data communication, to strengthen the human-to-human relationship required in such a high-tech environment.  

The evaluation of the application in the light of RACE criteria, together with user criteria defined early on in the project, should enable the consortium to contribute to a better understanding of the services and functions required in the IBC.  In addition, the definition of a generic application will lead to an effective exploitation of the results shortly after the IBC becomes operational.  

Key Issues  
The CAR consortium represents all key areas of industry and research and, therefore, can address telecommunications, information technology and automotive issues equally.  

Achievements  
In 1989 the project concentrated on establishing an initial set of organisational and end-user requirements and functional specification for the CAR application pilot.  

By the end of 1990 the initial application pilot design had concentrated on the key areas of development namely high speed communications, CAD/CAM applications, and multimedia services.  An experimental programme was set up based on this framework.  The early phase of the pre-implemented work concentrated on the implementation of these experiments and reported on discussions about a common development platform.

The project aims to install an electronic case handling system which will use a public broadband network. The system automates the paper based production process within departments of insurance companies.

The project is based on a distributed system of workstations and servers, connected on a fibre optics communications network. The workstations are equipped with high resolution screens on which advanced graphical user interfaces are available to the caseworkers. The servers are dedicated to the storage of databases, images, dossiers and voice information and use both magnetic and optical media. The communication network is based on existing standard local area networks, such as Ethernet and fibre distributed data interface (FDDI) 1.

The application is concentrated around the notion of caseplans. Caseplans are a computer representation of organisational procedures and guidelines that currently determine the way that case handling is done. Via these caseplans, the system can, amongst other activities, automatically transfer cases from caseworker to caseworker within the organisation, determine critical time triggers for casehandling activities, monitor all work to be done for the caseworkers and present overviews of the status of all cases. Specific requirements of a particular organisation may be met by customisation of the system with respect to caseplans, information structures and tools.

The workstations will be equipped with high-resolution screens on which advanced graphical user-interfaces will be available to the caseworkers.  The servers will be dedicated to the storage of databases, images, dossiers and voice- information and will use both magnetic and optical media.  The communication network will be based on existing standard local area networks, such as Ethernet and FDDI 1, using communication protocols such as TCP/IP and OSI protocols.  Inter-system-communication, primarily between the mainframe environment and the case handling environment, will be based on LU6.2.  

The application will be concentrated around the notion of so-called caseplans.  Caseplans are a computer- representation of organisational procedures and guidelines that currently determine the way that case handling is done.  Via these caseplans, the system can, amongst other activities, automatically transfer cases from caseworker to caseworker within the organisation, determine critical time triggers for casehandling activities, monitor all work to be done for the caseworkers and present overviews of the status of all cases.  Specific requirements of a particular organisation may be met by customisation of the system with respect to caseplans, information structures and tools.  

The system will initially be realised within a local environment.  Once this is operational, it will be extended beyond the domain of a single branch office, to connect agents, clients and related branches.

4348;GENO0048;SCW;;FP2-HUMGEN C;;FP2;Single Chromosome Workshops;01/03/1992;30/06/1993;;"Single chromosome workshops (SCWs) are an important, relatively new development in the global endeavour to map the human genome. They involve a small number of active researchers on a particular chromosome who meet once a year; their purposes are the agreeing of the map to date, the entry of data into GDB, the planning of future strategies to promote closure of the map, and, if appropriate, the sharing of biological materials such as a YAC library of the chromosome in question. 

This key activity requires competent coordination. Also the European activities in mapping the human genome have to be adequately represented at these workshops (ie all European scientists with a significant contribution to make will be enabled to participate). 

The broad goals of the concerted action are : 
to improve the organization of single chromosome workshops (SCWs); 
to provide a centralized mechanism for channelling the European participation and contribution, inclusive of support from CEC, for SCWs. 
Human gene mappers used to meet every 1 or 2 years at Human Gene Mapping (HGM) workshops, in order to collate work on assigning genes to chromosomes and to construct genetic maps. The tasks of the HGM workshops have been taken over by single chromosome workshops (SCW), which now provide the best means for the international genome community to construct consensus genetic and physical maps of the human genome. HUGO drew up a set of guidelines for the organization of SCWs. 

24 SCWs were held in 9 different countries. For all these workshops, HUGO made sure that adequate funding was provided. The SCW coordinator attended the workshops in order to advise on organizational matters, such as the presentation of reports, the submission of data to GDB, and the selection of dates and venus for future meetings. 
The achievements of SCWs were reviewed by HUGO staff at the Chromosome Coordinating Meeting where the HUGO guidelines were revised and it was agreed that: 
all intending participants must not only be willing to share data, but must have deposited it in GDB prior to the workshop (all data presented at an SCW are considered to be in the pubic domain); 
SCW reports should be submitted for publication not later than 1 month after the meeting and funding will be contingent on this; 
much more detailed guidance should be provided on data presentation at the workshops. The 8 SCWs held after the HUGO review at CCM92 have all complied with the revised guidelines.
The detailed tasks are : 
to organize and coorganize 16 SCWs during 1992; 
to provide a comprehensive guide to intending organizers of SCWs on how to plan, run and fund such a workshop; 
at each SCW to provide advice on: requirements for data entry to GDB, requirements for the report, and location and timing of the next workshop.

3039;MA2M0042;CAPUME;;FP2-MATREC C;;FP2;GENERALIZATION, IMPROVEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE COMPUTER AIDED PLANNING OF UNDERGROUND MINING EXPLOITATIONS;01/07/1991;31/12/1993;;"The objective of the research project is the generalization, improvement and implementation of the software package, CAPUME, in order to build up a more general and complete tool for mine planning. 
Research was carried out on the development of software modules for scheduling mining operations at long, medium and short term that could be integrated with the package that had already been developed during the preceeding project (CAPUME I). The model and monitoring of the processing plant of Aljustrel mine was also covered. The modules were developed using the real data on mining operations in the mines of Aljustrel (Portugal) and Olmedo (Italy). However, the computer structures were designed in such way as to ensure a more general applicability of the modules to allow its use under other mining and processing situations as well. 

The results of the tests carried out at Aljustrel and Olmedo mines in collaboration with the technicians of Pirites Alentejanas SA and Sardabauxiti SpA brought to light the fact that a careful application of the software for the long, medium and short term planning operations can make it possible to attain the preestablished production targets in a satisfactory manner. 

Analysis of these results allows the conclusion that these targets are easier to attain if mining operations involve a combination of working fronts at different stages. Under such conditions, the short term planning exercise, which was carried out with the greatest precision, must aim at producing ore with the required characteristics to permit the desired blending of ore extracted from drifts or crosscuts.
This software package for mine exploitation planning will cover the needs of medium to large underground mines concerning design and optimization in long, medium and short term production planning, grade control, stock management and economic evaluation and management. It will also constitute an integrated software package, portable and user friendly, of modular design and suitable for personal computer(PC) work stations. 

The project will comprise the following phases. 

Phase 1 is the generalization of the software package which will include: 
the development of new modules for the modelling and parametrization of the mining methods of Aljustrel and Masua mines, taking into consideration technical constraints (eg rock mechanics) block dimensions and other technical characteristics of each method; 
the adjustment of the software package to the medium term planning strategies of Aljustrel and Masua mines; 
and the adjustment of the short term planning and production scheduling modules in order to take into account the geometric constraints of the mining methods of the Aljustrel and Masua mines. 

Phase 2 is the integration of the mineral processing plant module which will include : 
the selection of models of the mineral processing plant unit operations; 
the calibration of the model selected, adjusting its fixed parameters according to the experimental data gathered around the circuit; 
the validation and testing of the calibrated models through the controlled variation of the operating conditions; 
the definition of the control parameters of the mineral processing plant unit operations and design of an expert system able to manage possible alterations of the whole system stage; 
the integration of the validated models in order to build a global plant treatment system; 
and the simulation of the plant treatment system and respective integration with the mine exploitation models. 

Phase 3 is the improvement of the package using data from the Aljustrel mine which will include: 
the development of new modules for the integration of geometric information (ore boundaries, panel geometry, development works, etc) and ore grade data into the system and the respective updating of the models developed during the planning stage accordingly; 
the updating of the short term planning and production scheduling in order to integrate new information coming from the exploitation of the mine; 
the updating of the medium term planning strategies according to new information taken during the exploitation of the mine; 
and the updating of the long term planning modules. 

Phase 4 is the implementation of the software towards industrialisation. The improvement of the applicability of the software package towards its industrialization involves testing the entire package and performing alterations and adjustments to improve its operationality in order to build up a more general and complete tool for mine planning. The software package will be installed in a workstation in the Aljustrel mine and adapted for use by the mine personnel.  The critical analysis of the use of the package will help for the finalization of the product.

A variety of physical and chemical measurements of the northern hemisphere lower stratosphere will be made from the ground, from large and small balloons and from aircraft. Supporting theoretical analyses will be carried out.  

During EASOE the following tasks will be accomplished. 
Ozone concentration profiles will be measured using ozone sondes at 18 sites. 
Ground based measurements will be made especially for EASOE at 20 northern hemisphere sites. Measurements will include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen nitrate, bromine oxide, chlorine oxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, temperature and polar stratospheric clouds.

Since the sensors are for use in a nuclear environment, particular attention was to be paid to their radiation tolerance.
Research has been carried out with respect to the integration of sensors of different spectral sensitives and various functions into a high precision pan and tilt platform to represent the recorded data in a clear and comprehensible way for telemanipulation and control tasks. 
The radiation tolerant stereoscopic camera with zoom lens provides an excellent, flicker-free 3-dimensional image to support the operator in driving the vehicle and in telemanipulation tasks. The range finder provides highly accurate distance measurements with appropriate calibration and has been demonstrated to be very highly radiation tolerant. The pan and tilt sensor platform was demonstrated to be capable of orienting a sensor package of up to 20 kg with high speed and precision, allowing it to follow every movement of a manipulator arm, even when the vehicle is highly tilted. The control panel and graphical interface provides user friendly control of the necessary functions. The complete system was tested and optimized. The overall integration of all of the sensor packages and the pan and tilt platform under control from 1 computer now enables the operator to perform his tasks without the fatigue associated with less developed independently controlled systems, and therefore greatly improved the effectiveness and quality of the missions which can be undertaken.
Exploitation
IBP Pietzsch will try to market the pan and tilt sensor platform as complete turn-key system, or as separate componennts. Other sensors can also be integrated into the sensor head as the pan and tilt platform can provide enough torque to handle additonal mass and volume. The AEA Technology radiation tolerant steroscopic zoom camera is being further developed for commercialisation and is also being integrated into the TM48 INGRID gantry-mounted tele-manipulator research machine project. The Le Conoscope range finder is being presented initially to users in the French nuclear industry for eventual commercial exploitation and European contacts will be promoted, probably through the VALUE programme. The test facility set up by KHG will be further exploited with external customers and for operator training and can be used in other TELEMAN research machine projects such as TM45 IMPACT and TM50 MESSINA.
Work to be done 

The development was to comprise the following components : 

- a conoscopic sensor, radiation tolerant, to generate distance data of an object (Le Conoscope); 
- a stereoscopic, radiation tolerant camera with zoom lens and low cabling requirements (AEA Harwell); 
- a sensor platform drive and work station to present the images and distance data (NCSR, IBP Pietzsch, KHG)  The development work of the pan and tilt platform was to concern radiation tolerance of mechanics and electronics as well as the development of an appropriate drive system. 

Furthermore, it was very important to specify a suitable mechanical and electrical standard interface for the sensors. Radiation tolerance was also to be a main aspect of development of the conoscopic sensor, which was to use natural light instead of coherent light to illuminate the object. 

A zoom lens stereo camera was essential because of user demand and work requirements, and was to be developed within the programme, building on AEA Harwell's earlier work on stereoscopic cameras of high precision and radiation tolerance.  The sensor platform drive unit and work station were to be completely configured and developed.  The main emphasis was to be put on multi-sensor integration, softkey control, real-time video processing and digital position representation.  An efficient man-machine interface using appropriate software was to be developed.

c To assess the health and social impact of osteoporosis in the populations studied.
d To assess the feasibility of using data derived from (a) and (b) above to lay the foundations for a subsequent prospective study.
The European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) is a population based study examining the prevalence of, and predictors for, vertebral osteoporosis. 17342 subjects aged 50 years and over were recruited from population based sampling frames in 36 centres in 18 European countries. Equal numbers of men and women were recruited in 6 5-year age bands, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 plus. Each subject completed an interviewer administered questionnaire and had lateral thoracolumbar radiography performed according to a standardized protocol. The X-rays were read morphometrically and the prevalence of fracture derived from these measurements. The average response rate in the participating centres was 48%, though there was wide geographical variation. Reproducibility of the questionnaire information and X-ray measurements was good. Data analysis is still continuing but preliminary results have shown that the prevalence of individual risk factors varied across the participating centres. Using the algorithm for vertebral fracture definition described by Eastell, the prevalence of vertebral fracture varied in those centres where the analysis is complete, by almost 2 fold for grade 2 deformities. The prevalence was highest in Malmo where 29% of females had evidence of significant vertebral deformity (grade 1).
Osteoporosis is a major cause of fracture and gives rise to significant morbidity and mortality particularly in the Western World. Hip fracture is the most widely studied site of fracture, reflecting the significant public health impact associated with it. In contrast to the detailed knowledge concerning hip fracture there are very few data on vertebral fracture. In part this is because vertebral fractures are often asymptomatic and require a radiographic survey to determine prevalence; but also because there is no consensus as to the definition of vertebral fracture. Reported prevalence estimates vary by up to 10 fold and published estimates of the sex ratio vary from a small male excess to a female excess of 7:1. The few data that exist elsewhere have utilised different methods, for assessment, and definition, of vertebral fracture; limiting direct comparison between studies. There is nevertheless increasing awareness that vertebral fracture accounts for significant morbidity in the population.";;;;CON;University of Manchester;UK;;;

The international CHEMVAL project has been assessing the validity of computer based models used to describe the chemistry of radioactive waste disposal systems. This project aims to build on earlier studies by targeting specific areas shown to be of particular concern in radiological assessment. Working groups have been established for all technical activities. These will undertake data collation and model verification tests. More demanding validation exercises will be considered only when the new models have been verified adequately but searches for suitable laboratory and field experiments have already begun. In the case of coupled chemical transport modelling, where most of the codes to be used have already been tested to some extent, the situation is more advanced. Bespoke column experiments have been commissioned allowing a methodology for predictive migration modelling to be specified.

A programme of work aimed at assessing the effects of elevated temperatures on the speciation and solubility of radioelements in groundwaters is underway and a series of verification tests have been formulated.

The objectives of work on sorption processes within CHEMVAL2 are to compare the various models which have been incorporated into geochemical speciation codes and to assess their usefulness for simulating observed behaviour in the laboratory and the field. A review of sorption models of varying complexity has been undertaken with emphasis on data availability and the applicability of each approach to predictive modelling studies.

The European Community concerted action on the epidemiology and prevention of diabetes involved nearly 100 centres throughout Europe and comprised 3 subareas of research: 
the epidemiology and aetiopathogenesis of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); 
the complications and mortality in IDDM; 
the epidemiology of diabetes from routine health information. 

In subarea A the incidence of IDDM in children aged up to 15 years was studied in 24 regions in Europe and Israel. Incidence rates varied widely from 4.6 (northern Greece) to 42.9 (Finland) cases per 100000 per year. There was an unexpectedly high incidence in Sardinia, which had the second highest rate recorded in Europe. 

In subarea B the frequency of diabetic complications in representative samples of IDDM patients attending 31 European diabetes centres was investigated. A total of 3279 IDDM patients were studied using standardized methods. There was a wide variation in the frequency of complications between the centres. Incipient diabetic renal disease, characterized by elevated urinary albumin excretion rates (microalbuminuria) varied in frequency between 13% and 34%, while the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy ranged from 28% to 59%. Imported associations of raised blood pressure with several complications, such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease and retinopathy were shown and these findings may have preventive implications. 

In subarea C studies were carried out of the death certification and coding practices related to diabetes in several European countries. Physician registration of diabetes as the underlying cause of death varied between 21% (France) and 35% (Germany). There were even larger variations in national coding of the same death certificates. 

A study of the utilization of drug sales data for epidemiological purposes was also carried out. In 3 European countries, estimation of diabetes prevalence through drug consumption gave results 4 to 20% lower than those from field surveys. A wide variety of prescribing habits for diabetic patients in Europe was demonstrated. 

A monograph entitled 'Diabetes in Europe' will be published in 1994.
The objectives of EURODIAB Sub-area A were:
- To characterize the incidence of IDDM in various regions of the EC and Europe;
- To confirm or refute existing evidence of a south-north gradient in IDDM incidence;
- To prepare the way for further studies to determine the nature of genetic and environmental factors and their (inter)actions in the aetiology and pathogenesis of IDDM.

The objectives of EURODIAB Sub-area B were:
- To measure the frequency of renal, retinal, neuropathic and macrovascular complications in representative samples of IDDM patients attending 31 clinics in 16 European countries, using standardised, validated methods;
- To measure the distribution of established and putative risk factors (exposures) for these complications, including, for example, blood pressure, plasma lipids, urinary albumin excretion, fibrinogen, quality of glycaemic control, genetic markers and dietary factors;
- To examine the relation complications and exposures, within and across centres. Examples of specific relations to be examined are:

1 the relation between blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion;
2 the relation between dietary protein intake and urinary albumin excretion;
3 the relation between blood pressure and retinopathy;
4 the relation between severe hypoglycaemia, and autonomic neuropathy;
5 the relation between dietary fat intake, serum lipids and cardiovascular disease;

5. The establishment of a new group on molecular biology and ageing.
The EURAGE network encompasses European research groups active in biomedical ageing research. EURAGE has promoted distribution of information, exchange of researchers and provision of animals and biological material throughout the European countries.
The SENIEUR protocol, developed under EURAGE, specifies criteria for the healthy elderly for inclusion in studies on normal ageing. As a consequence some generally accepted age related changes were proven not to be due to ageing but to disease processes. These changes include a decrease in the number of immunological T-cells and an increase in the frequency of autoimmune phenomena.
During ageing involution of the thymus occurs leaving the elderly with a lack of immume reactivity especially against new infectious challenges. New strategies were developed for the improvement of both overall immunity and vaccination efficiency in the elderly. Combined European clinical and experimental studies in the field of influenza vaccination are currently underway.
In the field of brain ageing and dementia, diagnostic criteria have been set out in neuropathology. Catalogues of brain tissue banks from normal and demented persons have been made available with a view to investigation of a genetic basis for senile dementia.
Studies on lens ageing were aimed at the development of strategies for cataract prevention or to delay the progression of early opacities by the use of anti cataract agents or the elimination of risk factors. The results indicate that anti oxidant therapy is not likely to be successful, most probably inhibitors of oxidant metabolism will be more useful.
A study of hepatic ageing allowed the clarification of the mechanisms of impaired drug clearance in the elderly and the development of new techniques for the study of the increased sensitivity of ageing organisms to drug effects. Also the relation between Kupffer cell functions and the susceptability to infection in old age was thoroughly investigated in conjuncti on with metabolic and endocrine response to injury and trauma.
Finally, EURAGE resulted in the formal classification of 4 categories of monoclonal gammapathies resulting in new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients suffering from these disorders.
In most European countries the over-65 age group constitutes the most rapidly increasing segment of the population and, thereby, presents unprecedented challenges to the medical care systems of each country. The resources which are presently available and those planned for the near future fall far short of the projected needs brought about by the virtual doubling of this population segment by the year 2020. 

The past record of the success of biomedical research in controlling human diseases and the ensuring savings resulting from reduced morbidity and mortality justify a substantial investment of funds and resources for the stimulation and coordination of European research activities. These should be directed at a detailed understanding of the genetic and biochemical basis of age-related diseases and the fundamental causes of the ageing process itself. 

The increase in the number of older Europeans, as well as the incidence of age-related diseases and the large monetary sums allocated to health care for elderly persons led to the EC's concerted action in the discipline of medial gerontology (EURAGE).";;;;CON;TNO Institute of Ageing and Vascular Research;NL;;;
3852;MR4*0209;EVA;;FP2-MHR 4C;1.4;FP2;EUROPEAN VACCINE AGAINST AIDS;01/07/1989;30/06/1992;;"Programme EVA (European Vaccine against AIDS) was launched in July 1989 with the twin objectives of supplying high quality research reagents to support European efforts aimed at developing safe and effective vaccines against AIDS and promoting collaborative European research projects towards vaccine development through initiating a dialogue between various research groups within the EC and COST countries.
The European Vaccine against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) programme (EVA) was launched in July 1989 with the twin objectives of supplying high quality research reagents to support European efforts aimed at developing safe and effective vaccines against AIDS and promoting collaborative European research projects towards vaccine development. Development and evaluation of AIDS vaccine require carefully controlled experiments in animal models. Since its inception, the EVA programme has focused attention on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in monkeys since, in this model, a disease that closely resembles human AIDS is produced. A large multicentre collaborative SIV vaccine trial involving 9 laboratories in 6 European countries was carried out using a large batch of purified virus and other reagents provided by Programme EVA. The trial demonstrated that a strong protective immune response against both homologous and heterologous SIV grown in human cells could be generated by both whole, inactivated and subunit vaccines with a range of different adjuvants in both rhesus and cynomologous macaques. When these protected animals were rechallenged with cell free SIV grown in simian cells, all the vaccinees became infected, although 4 out of 8 animals challenged with cell associated SIV remained protected. These unexpected findings along with other related studies indicate that non-virus specific cellular antigens acquired during the growth of SIV in human cells may be contributing significantly to the protective immune response. Other work supported by the Programme includes the development of a primate challenge virus stock, the evaluation of virus derived native envelope glycoprotein as a vaccine immunogen, the provision of reagents for studies on HIV variation and work on defective viruses as attenuated vaccines.
The spread of HIV infection and AIDS presents one of the most pressing public health problems in the world today. The WHO has estimated that by the end of 1993, over 15 million people world-wide have been infected with HIV. In European countries the epidemic has also continued to spread, with 103,000 AIDS cases currently reported and an estimated 500,000 people infected with the virus. Health education approaches can play a role in preventing the spread of AIDS, but in many communities this is likely to have limited impact. On the other hand, the development of a safe, effective and easily administered prophylactic vaccine for large-scale use in at-risk individuals and communities would make a major contribution towards curtailing the epidemic.

HIV presents a particular challenge for vaccine design since the virus can exist in a latent form and may mutate rapidly thereby escaping immune surveillance. Animal challenge experiments combined with detailed studies of the immune responses in challenge animals are essential in order to provide the key information necessary for the design of a safe and effective HIV vaccine, AIDS vaccine development is still at an early stage: the HIV antigens required to induce a protective immune response have not yet been identified, the immunological basis for protection has not been established and the significance of virus variation for vaccine development has not been fully explored. High quality academic research in immunology and virology is required to answer these questions before industry can usefully embark on major vaccine development programmes.";;;;CON;National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC);UK;;;
4027;MR4*0275;TRANSGENEUR;;FP2-MHR 4C;;FP2;Application of the new biology and transgenic techniques to cardiovascular research;01/07/1990;30/06/1992;;"This concerted action focused on the utilisation of state of the art molecular techniques to develop new animal models for hypertension and cardiovascular disease and thereby elucidate the causes of human primary hypertension. Our goal was to establish a unique programme to introduce discrete genetic changes into the genome of the rat, in order to understand not only the regulation of genes important to the function of the cardiovascular system, but also to gain insight into their involvement in hypertensive mechanisms. 

Specifically, the purpose of this concerted action was to adapt transgenic technology to questions in cardiovascular research by the establishment of transgenic rats and to ensure the cooperation of European members who otherwise would have no access to such animals and who could offer laboratory expertise for detailed pathophysiological, hemodynamic, electrophysiological, endocrinological, pharmacological, environmental and behavioural investigations. 

Specific aims 

a) The establishment of transgenic rat methodology and introduction of the mouse Ren2 into the rat genome. 
b) The preparation of new gene constructs by participating groups and the introduction of the constructs into the rat germline. 
c) The distribution of new animal models to participants in TRANSGENEUR for detailed study utilising the specialised techniques available through combined efforts of the participants. 
d) The establishment of a permanent cryogenic preservation facility for the storage of transgenic lines, especially those which are not required immediately by other laboratories is an important aim of this collaboration.
A central facility has been set up to develop and utilise transgenic technology in the rat and to make available new and more genetically defined animal models of hypertension to researchers in Europe. Several new and genetically defined hypertensive animal strains were generated by introduction of the mouse renin gene into the rat germline. The most interesting of the initial strains, TGRmRen2-27, has been successfully bred to homozygosity. This has been achieved by maintaining the animals on antihypertensive treatment, and means that the breeding and distribution of the strain is more efficient. Transgenic rat strains have also been constructed carrying human renin and human angiotensinogen genes. In addition, transgenic lines generated recently include hypertensive mice carrying the rat angiotensinogen gene. Collaborative studies are wide ranging and include the transfer of animals, gene constructs and plasmid vectors and methodology training.

A major success has been the active use of a cryogenic storage facility for transfer of frozen rat embryos. Test results on the first animals born from cryopreserved embryos and of other animals within the central facility showed them to be pathogen free. The preferred method of shipment of genetic lines is via frozen embryos and training in handling of embryos has been given.

The development of novel strains of a genetically hypertensive animal, whose genetic abnormality is defined, has given a new dimension to research within the field and provided a new experimental impetus in the fight against these diseases.
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality accounts for about 50% of deaths in industrialised countries and is one of the major health issues of our time. 20% of the adult population has hypertension, the most important cause of cardiovascular mortality. Primary hypertension in man and spontaneously hypertensive rats is hereditary and it is believed that 4-6 major genes are involved. On this genetic basis environmental factors, lifestyle and diet can affect the phenotype. Although there are several animal models of hypertension, most notably the spontaneously hypertensive and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP), to date the underlying genetic lesions in these animals have not been identified. Recent genetic mapping data show that a gene close to or coincident with the angiotensin converting enzyme gene is partially responsible for the hypertension in the SHR-SP strain. A formal demonstration will require gene transfer experiments of the type proposed in this application to be undertaken, and such experiments have been made possible in large part through the efforts of the TRANSGENEUR concerted action over the last two years. Large gaps remain in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of hypertension and the identification of the genes involved. The preparation of new animal strains to test the contribution of specific genes has been shown to be a valid and exciting new avenue and several groups in the USA are initiating the construction of novel rat strains using in vivo gene transfer techniques. With the available expertise amongst the participants of this programme and the infrastructure support of the concerted action, European hypertension researchers have an unparalleled opportunity to utilise state of the art techniques to enhance their research into this disease.";;;;CON;University of Edinburgh;UK;;;

The system response analyzer (SRA) will serve to: identify potential problem areas; provide quantitative data; and evaluate the effects of specific modifications. 

The overall purpose of the project is to provide a system response analyzer (SRA), in the form of a software tool, which can be used to analyze the influence of human decision making and action on the way in which system accidents evolve. The SRA can be used : 
to identify the aspects of the task and the human computer interaction (HCI) where problems are likely to occur; 
to provide quantitative data as input to a more formal PSA or HRA; 
and to test specific modifications to the system (eg of procedures, information presentation, control options, etc). 

Primarily to be used during system design, the SRA provides a tool for systematically examining possible scenario development, depending on how the operator interacts with the system.  It can further be applied to post incident analysis to elicit additional information from experts, explore possible alternative development sequences, and train operators and engineers in incident handling.  Innovative fully symbolic simulation of process and operator, on equal terms, will be used. The SRA has the advantage of being flexible, thus allowing exploration of a wide range of topics as well as a number of local versions.  Through its application, precise clarification of how the configuration of the physical system serves to transform erroneous human actions into accidents will be possible.  This will provide a basis for devising practical counter measures aimed at improving human reliability under operational conditions.";;;;CSC;Computer Resources International A/S;DK;Aérospatiale Protection Systèmes;FR;
8522;2075;APACHIP;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Advanced Packaging for High Performance;16/01/1989;15/01/1993;;"The APACHIP project addressed the field of advanced VLSI packaging. It was aimed at providing advanced packaging solutions for multichip modules and for single chip package applications. 
The APACHIP project is making excellent progress on Multi-Chip Modules and on material such as TAB tapes, connectors and ceramic-based packages, all suitable for high density, high pincount applications. The work programme covers all areas from high density chip assembly and interconnection, using very fine substrates, to packaging and testing. Design is also included. Functional demonstrators have been designed and are being built, to show how the developements can be incorporated into exploitable products. They vary in size from a few integrated circuits to many dozens, in speed and power (bipolar or complementary metal oxide semiconductor) and in cooling method. There are also novel single-chip packages. These advanced interconnection and packaging techniques could be applied widely and make a significant industrial impact.

The project addresses the field of advanced very large scale integration (VLSI) packaging. It provides advanced packaging solutions for multichip modules and for single chip package applications. The project develops packaging techniques for highly integrated bipolar circuits requiring liquid cooling, and also for the even more integrated metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) VLSIs, where air cooling techniques can still be applied. VLSI chips, whether bipolar or MOS, are assembled using tape automated bonding (TAB). The necessary TAB tape is being developed and introduced to the European market.

The efficient interconnection of VLSI chips requires the availability of high density high performance substrates. 2 different approaches of high density substrate realization are included in the research. 1 proceeds from printed circuit board like technology to achieve very dense interconnection and miniature laser formed vias; the other approach uses thin film deposited and electrolytically reinforced copper lines separated by polyimide layers. This copper polyimide structure is applied on a large size ceramic substrate, also developed in the project. A new connector concept is being defined to test the multichip or single chip substrates populated with TAB chips and to connect them into systems. Electrical modelling, reliability aspects and new inspection methods are also included in the project.

3146;STEP0056;NITREX;;FP2-STEP;;FP2;Nitrogen saturation experiments;01/08/1991;31/07/1993;;"The objective is to investigate the effects of nitrogen deposition in European ecosystems and to evaluate the degree of nitrogen saturation in these ecosystems. 
NITREX (nitrogen saturation experiments) is a research project focused on the impact of nitrogen on forest ecosystems. The project addresses the role of nitrate and ammonium in acidification of soil and water by addition or removal of nitrogen to precipitation falling on headwater catchments and forest stands.

The sites comprise nearly pristine areas with no appreciable output of inorganic nitrogen, intermediate areas, and highly impacted areas with nitrogen outputs nearly equal to inputs and segregate between those which receive less than 150 meq m{-2} y{-1} total nitrogen and leach little or no nitrogen and those which receive greater than 200 meq m{-2} y{-1} and leach significant amounts of nitrogen. By increasing nitrogen inputs at the low deposition sites, and decreasing them at the high deposition sites, the experiments are designed to move all the ecosystems across the threshold of nitrogen saturation, either forward or backward.

It is assumed that different ecosystem compartments will react to the treatments at different rates. Differences in soil and vegetation characteristics should already be present among the sites, however, due to the existing differences in nitrogen deposition.

The soils data from the sites indicate differences that could be partly due to the pollution gradient. Soil pH and % base saturation, both indicators of soil acidification, show a gradient from high to low along the input pollution gradient. There is no cation exchange capacity (CEC) gradient. The vegetation data also show differences that may reflect nitrogen inputs. Changes in pools of soil and vegetation nitrogen will be difficult to detect directly because of the large pool sizes relative to the annual fluxes. The nitrogen-15 tracer experiments, however, by showing the allocation of the added nitrogen, will provide direct evidence of even small changes in the pools.

Nitrogen will be added at an enrichment of 1500, 6000 and 120000 parts per thousand delta nitrogen -15 (isotopic composition is expressed in terms of delta values or parts per thousand differences from a standard).

The levels of enrichment used are for the total inputs to the forest floor (ie both the throughfall and fertilizer inputs). Additional nitrogen-15 will be added to the fertilizer to compensate for the (predicted) throughfall nitrogeninputs. The nitrogen-15 will be applied for 1 year and its fate followed in tree, soil and leachate pools.

NITREX (nitrogen saturation experiments) is a research project focused on the impact of nitrogen on forest ecosystems. The project addresses the role of nitrate and ammonium in acidification of soil and water by addition or removal of nitrogen to precipitation falling on headwater catchments and forest stands.

Within the NITREX programme a process oriented, deterministic simulation model for heat, water, nitrogen and carbon cycling has been developed. The model (NIICCE; nitrogen isotopes and carbon cycling in coniferous ecosystems) is intended as a tool for interpretation of results of experiments on atmospheric input of nitrogen to coniferous forest ecosystems.

NIICCE is developed to interpret results of tracer experiments with nitrogen-15, and has been provisionally used to predict amounts of the tracer needed in experimentally enriched throughfall to reach levels of nitrogen-15 in various pools high enough to discriminate between variation in the isotope's natural abundance and increased levels after experimental addition. It also simulates turnover of stable isotopes of carbon. NIICCE simulates processes such as primary production, mineralization, decomposition, root uptake, transport of solutes, and isotope fractionation of nitrogen for a coniferous forest in a 1-dimensional, multicompartment soil profile. The model is intended to be used for forests with a closed canopy, older than about 20 years. Fluxes of atmospheric and/or experimental input of nitrogen compounds (throughfall and canopy exchange) are inputs to the model, together with data on global short wave radiation, precipitation and temperature. NIICCE is implemented as Quick Basic (version 4.5) multimodule compiler code. The execution time of the model running on a 80386SX 16MHz personal computer with numeric coprocessor is 5 to 10 minutes for a 1-year simulation period. NIICCE has been used for simulation of nitrogen cycling in 2 NITREX sites, Speuld in the Netherlands and Klosterhede in Denma rk but the results of simulations should be considered provisional. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis will be performed using a MonteCarlo procedure and the model will calibrated using data form the Speuld and Klosterhede site collected before the start of the NITREX experiments. Validation will be performed using data collected during the NITREX programme and the model will be extended with a module simulating gas transport.
The project aims to answer the questions of continued or increased nitrogen deposition leading to nitrogen saturation in sensitive areas in Europe and planned future decreases in nitrogen deposition reversing nitrogen saturation in impacted areas of central Europe by experimentally changing nitrogen deposition to entire ecosystems, either catchments (Norway and Sweden) or large forest stands (Denmark, West Germany, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom). 

NITREX is an international, interdisciplinary research project encompassing ecosystem scale experiments with nitrogen in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, West Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These nitrogen experiments comprise a European network spanning the gradient in nitrogen deposition from high deposition in the Netherlands to low deposition in Norway. The same team of investigators and the same techniques will be used at all sites. The network will be at the catchment scale where feasible, and nitrogen will be added or removed to simulate natural precipitation. 

Precipitation, throughfall, soil, soil solution and runoff volume and chemical composition will be measured using standard procedures. In addition the growth and vitality of the above ground vegetation will be monitored and the nutrient status and cycling in the forest will be followed (litterfall, needle composition, soil organic matter composition and mass, fine root biomass). Nitrogen-15 will be added to follow the fate of nitrogen within the ecosystems and to trace the source of nitrogen leached from the ecosystems. 

Together, these experimental data will form the basis for extensive cross European comparisons and for the development and refinement of process oriented models for nitrogen in coniferous ecosystems. These comparisons and the modelling work are aimed at evaluating the potential for nitrogen saturation, the reversibility of nitrogen saturation, critical loads for nitrogen in coniferous forests, and the potential combined effects of forest use, atmospheric pollution and climate change. 

NITREX will include a total of 9 large scale experiments at 7 sites in 6 European countries as follows. 
Nitrogen addition at a small catchment (G2) with Norway spruce at Gaardsjoen in western Sweden. 
Nitrogen removal (by roof) at a small catchment (G1) with Norway spruce at Gaardsjoen in western Sweden.

- one-micron and low-voltage (1.5 V, 2 micron design rule) CMOS (in the first phase of the project) 
- 0.8 micron and low-voltage (1.5 V, 1.5 micron design rule) CMOS (in the second phase).
The goal of the project is the integration of new generation reprogrammable, read only memory devices (both erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) and (EEPROM)) into 1 micron and low voltage (1.5 V, 2 micron design rule) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and 0.8 micron and low voltage (1.5 V, 1.5 micron design rule) CMOS for the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) market. During the second phase of the project, major emphasis is being placed on the integration of flash EEPROM, particularly by silicon technology (ST).

The effect of cell size reduction, layout and processing options on cell performance have been evaluated. Concerning the processing, particular attention has been given to the impact on the cells of the implementation of both EPROM and EEPROM in the basic CMOS process. With respect to cell architecture, the most promising ones include the split gate cell with enhanced injection, and the trench gate oxide cell. The work on computer aided design (CAD) tools and cell library has included the generation of a power distribution checker, the investigation of automatic layout tools for electrically reconfiguarable logic arrays, and the development of EPROM and EEPROM generators allowing the maximum modularity in terms of number of bits and number of words.

The demonstrators, most of which are now in the advanced testing/qualification phase, include:
a 10K gate array incorporating 2K EEPROM;
16K EEPROM parameterizable block embedded in a 50K gate array;
an 8-bit microcontroller incorporating both EPROM (48K) and EEPROM (1 to 2K) for automotive applications;
a low power low voltage integrated circuit (IC) for identification applications;
a low power low voltage IC for identification of cargo containers;
an intelligent battery charger for optimum nickel cadmium battery life;
an IC for the personalization of electrical power meters;
an IC for use insmart cards;
an IC for music electronics.

Finally, 2 technologies d eveloped by ST have been transferred to production to make microcontrollers with embedded memory for applications including credit cards, pay television, computer peripherals, and in the growing automotive market. 2 additional processes are in the preproduction phase for, for example, gate arrays, identification ICs and microcontrollers.
At the start of the project the availability of cell libraries and CAD tools for non-volatile memory was quite limited. One of the main objectives of the project has thus been the development of cell libraries for EPROM and EEPROM blocks and distributed memory, together with all the support circuitry, such as decoders, sense amplifiers, high voltage generators, etc. CAD tools to design and correctly match memory blocks of arbitrary size had also to be developed, as well as routing tools to handle the special high voltage requirements.";;;;;GEC Plessey Semiconductors plc;UK;"Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschung eV (FhG);DEISTER ELECTRONIC;Thomson Microelectronics Srl (SGS);SGS Thomson Microelectronics SA;EUROSIL ELECTRONIC;MIKRON;GEMPLUS CARD INTERNATIONAL;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK;Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble;Università degli Studi di Bologna;Istituto di Ricerca per l'Industria dello Spettacolo;Interuniversitair Mikroelektronica Centrum";"DE;IT;FR;PT;IE;BE";

A prototype system will be developed containing a set of tools for the integration and fusion of visual and non-visual data provided by different kind of sensors. 
Special tools for the acquisition and merging of multisensor data, for low-level image and signal processing and for adaptive data fusion will be developed and used in the construction of a monitoring and control system for subway stations. The concept o f adaptive and robust control will be investigated, and a tool allowing flexible adaptation of the multisensors to a changing scene will be implemented. 
The interpretation processes will be optimised in order to recognise objects by the parallel execution of search, detection and matching tasks. 
DIMUS will incorporate several existing systems produced by the partners for stereo, motion and range-finding, and will also use visual-tactile sensor systems. A moving camera subsystem for focusing attention on particular regions of the subway environme n t will also be developed. The exploitation of knowledge-based methods for the recognition of moving objects will be investigated. 
The demonstration of intermediate results concerning the adaptation of the multisensors to the environment is scheduled to take place after 17 months. This will show the fusion of visual and non-visual information in order to support a focus of attention on an area of interest. The final demonstration will be performed in a real metro station environment shortly before the end of the project.
Combining several types of sensorial data obtained from many sources of information (data fusion) has the advantage of providing robust problem solving in the presence of missing or faulty sensorial data, due to information redundancy and diversity. Several applications of this technique have been investigated.

Information provided by magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography has been integrated to give a 3-dimensional view of the reconstructed cerebral blood vessels surrounding an aneurysm, to assist in the division processes of medical diagnosis and therapy.

Fuzzy logic has been implemented to aid the decision making process for a robot gripping device, and to run petrochemical processes in a large production plant.

Odometric data and a laser range scanner have been combined to provide a global view of the environment for semi autonomous robots, capable, for example, of remote surveillance tasks.

Image processing and interpretation tasks of various types have been made easier by the use of multisensor visual information. Applications include surveillance of traffic and pedestrians.

These languages have many advantages for software development over imperative languages because of their sound mathematical  foundations. The objective is to incorporate the functional and logic programming paradigms within one language and implementation framework. In order to achieve complete and practical solutions, the integration of these paradigms was investigated at all levels: the specification of programs and large systems description; the transformation  and refinement of programs; and at the level of the underlying abstract machines.
The technologies necessary to make a practical declarative programming language were developed by studying combinations of the most important approaches to the design and implementation of such languages. These were investigated at all levels (ranging from language definitions to the underlying abstract machines) in order to provide a practical method of mapping high level system descriptions onto efficient implementations for a range of target machines.

Based on a systematic classification of existing declarative languages the PHOENIX design space (PDS) was developed using assertional programming. The mathematical semantic foundations of languages were expressed in terms of general logics, and the constrained deduction calculus was designed to provide a general framework for investigating the computational models of integrated languages.
2 new declarative programming paradigms have been developed, constraint functional logic programming designing using semantics based integration methodology and guarded functional programming with lazy streams (GFP).
In parallel with the language design space, a design space of abstract machines has been developed to implement PDS languages and a general computational model has been proposed for the implementation of constraint based languages.
The JUMP machine has been designed and a GFP language (Guarded TermML) has been implemented based on the JUMP machine.
The classification of exisiting type and module systems led to the development of AIAS, a language independent system for expressing higher order parameterization and abstraction.
Further important results include a characterization of program transformations as inductive proofs in the framework of the PDS extensions of GFP.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
In the first phase, current technology has been evaluated in order to identify the subjects which need further development. This concerns all three levels of the hierarchical approach adopted. In particular, attention is being focused on: 
-A classification of the language concepts of declarative programming paradigms including the semantic models behind them, and the relations between them. This classification will lead to the 'Phoenix Design Space', a general framework for studying and d eveloping declarative languages. 
-An evaluation of existing type and module systems for supporting programming in-the-large. 
-An evaluation of transformation technologies. 
-An evaluation of existing abstract machines for declarative languages and of techniques for systematic derivation of abstract machines from formal language descriptions. 
In the second phase, the insights obtained are used to carry out concrete work in language design, transformation technology, and abstract machine design. The whole programme of work is supported by a case-study, where different languages will be used to implement a sample problem. The different implementations were evaluated in order to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the various design techniques. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
-Based on a systematic classification of existing declarative languages, the PHOENIX Design Space (PDS) takes a uniform view of declarative programming languages by developing the notion of assertional programming. The mathematical semantic foundations o f languages are expressed in terms of general logics, and the constrained deduction calculus is designed so as to provide a general framework for investigating the computational models of integrated languages. 
-Two new declarative programming paradigms have been developed. Constraint Functional Logic Programming has been designed by means of a semantics based integration methodology which directly evolved from the PDS. In contrast, Guarded Functional Programmi ng with Lazy Streams (GFP*) has been developed pragmatically driven by the needs which became apparent through the case study. 
-In parallel with the language design space, a design space of abstract machines has been developed which supports all features necessary to implement PDS languages. In addition, a general computational model has been proposed for the implementation of c onstraint based languages. 
-The JUMP machine has been designed, which supports reduction, narrowing, and SLD-resolution, and simplified versions of two functional abstract machines which make lambda-lifting unnecessary. A GFP* language (Guarded TermML) has been implemented based o n the JUMP machine. 
-The classification of existing type and module systems led to the development of AIAS, a language-independent system for expressing higher order parameterisation and abstraction. 
-Further important results include a characterisation of program transformations as inductive proofs in the framework of the PHOENIX Design Space, extensions of GFP* to support concurrency and interaction by means of temporal logic annotations, an extend ed non-deterministic lambda-calculus as a uniform operational model for integrated languages, and a specification formalism for abstract machines which allows rapid prototyping of machines (Update Plans). 
POTENTIAL 
The integration of declarative programming paradigms will benefit software development because it promises powerful descriptive capabilities, the availability of formal manipulation and transformation rules, and the potential for parallel execution. The improvements in descriptive capabilities and the development of efficient implementation will significantly increase the availability and reliability of the declarative paradigm for practical applications. The unification of the two main approaches to declarative programming will, in addition, stimulate the two separate schools of research through the cross-fertilisation of ideas.";;;;;Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung mbH;DE;"IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT NIJMEGEN";"UK;NL";
8209;3228;SPRINT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Speech Processing and Recognition Using Integrated Neurocomputing Techniques;10/04/1989;09/10/1991;;"The aim of the SPRINT Action was to examine whether connectionist techniques can be used to improve the current performance of automatic speech recognition systems, with particular respect to speaker independence and noise insensitivity. 
Answers were sought to the following questions: 
-How can the recogniser be provided with robust features adapted to new speakers or environments? 
-How can acoustic parameters be mapped onto phonetic symbols using different neural network paradigms? 
-How can the competitive learning approach be applied to high-level speech processing in order to understand the lexicon structures? 
-How can isolated words be recognised, considering the problems related to time-varying word patterns and noise immunity?
Various unsolved problems in speech recognition were tackled by exploring the distinctive features of neural networks (eg, non-linearity, self-organisation, parallelism) to upgrade the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. The connectionist paradigms were exploited to investigate some of the problems in relationship with speech variabilities: adaption to new speakers and/or new environments, noise immunity, classification of speech parameters using a set of phonetic symbols, and recognition of isolated words (lexical access). Theoretical studies have been conducted to establish the capabilities of various neural networks to generate any spectral transformation. For each network architecture, the ability to discriminate between several classes during classification was also evaluated. The evaluation of speaker adaption procedures based on learning spectral transformation with multilayer perceptrons was conducted. Well established methods were compared. The use of neural networks to carry out the transformations of speech parameters, necessary for recognition that is robust with respect to speech signals contaminated by background noise was investigated. Preliminary experiments have been carried out. Evaluation of very simple structures of perceptions: sparsely connected neural nets (neural nets with different topologies: local connection (TDNN), scally or fully connected) for spectra and isolated work classification was conducted. These experiments showed the need for specifically designed networks. Experiments with LVQ alone, a TDNN-derived network alone and combined TDNN-LVQ architectures proved the combined architecture to be the most efficient. An examination was made of the scally network topology for noise robustness and for use with various approaches to time alignment. The use of added noise in training to improve generalisation was investigated. An information theoretic distance metric was developed, together with a multilayer perception which has outputs with a probabilistic interpretation.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The speech representation levels considered are signal, parameter, phonetic and lexical. The main areas of investigation were: 
-The transition from the signal to the parameter level and transitions within the parameter level: research will provide the recognition system with a set of parameters leading to the best performance. Transformations of classical speech representationsare investigated, based on multi-layer perceptrons, topological maps, and the learning vector quantification method. 
-The transition from the parameter to the phonetics level: various feed-forward neural network topologies have been assessed, and some found to integrate  prior knowledge. 
-The transition from the phonetic to the (sub)lexical level: the competitive learning approach is used to determine the structure of the lexicon and the structure between morpheme units and the phonemes. 
-The transition from the parameter to the lexical level: the ability of various network paradigms to learn to generalise has been examined in order to deal with intra and inter-speaker variability and background noise. The problem of recognising time-var ying speech patterns has been approached by transforming the speech signal to fit the fixed size network input layer. Architectures and hybrid systems that integrate neural networks with well-established approaches are used. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS OF OCTOBER 1991 
The available deliverables report on the following research activities: 
-Theoretical studies have been conducted to establish the capabilities of various neural networks to generate any spectral transformation. For each network architecture, the ability to discriminate between several classes during classification was also e valuated.

Phases 1 to 3 of the project achieved the CNMA objectives of specifying, implementing, validating and promoting emerging communications standards, and placed its participants in an internationally competitive position.
This project continued the work on a communications network for manufacturing applications (CNMA). During this phase manufacturing message specification (MMS), directory service and file transfer and manipulation (FTAM) industrial communications protocols were addressed, together with the associated application interfaces. Original work was performed on an intelligent network management system. The project also addressed enhanced performance architectures and the protocol gateways necessary to solve user migration problems. These developments were applied to 2 types of manufacturing environment. An experimental pilot, free from the pressures of a manufacturing facility, was used for the first application of the communication developments. Further validation has been achieved by the application of the communication software to real production facilities.
The workplan included: preparation of case studies of user communication strategies, definition of CNMA implementation guide, subsequent implementation by vendors on minicomputers and controllers, verification of the profiles by the application of vendor hardware and software to experimental and real production environments, promotion of experience gained within standards bodies and provision of CNMA expertise through technical exchange and information dissemination.
By their participation in the project the partners have ensured a high level of European expertise in this rapidly evolving and vital area of computer integrated manufacture (CIM) development. The CIM users are able to make informed choices on the evolution of their own internal communication systems whilst the information technology (IT) vendors are able to ensure that international agreements on communications protocols are rapidly incorporated into commercial products.

This will provide support for the development of new applications that take advantage of the added value provided by combining traditional computer media and information systems with digital video and audio technology. 

The goal of MULTIWORKS is to develop an office workstation that manipulates video, graphics, text, voice and sound with facilities comparable to those available today for traditional text and graphics media.
Multimedia integrated workstation (MULTIWORKS) is a technology integration project aiming to design an integrated multimedia workstation and a low cost delivery system for the office of the future. It is based on European technology and complies with international standards. Full use is made of high performance European reduced instruction set computer (RISC) technology, and speed of execution is ensured via access to state of the art very large scale integration (VLSI) technology. MULTIWORKS software also uses European technology for its operating system. It is UNIX compatible and will adhere to international standards.

The goal of the multimedia integrated workstations (MULTIWORKS) project was to develop an office workstation that manipulated video, graphics, text, voice and sound with facilities comparable to those available today for traditional text and graphics media.

2 system configurations are provided: a high cost authoring workstation, called MIW, and a low cost delivery system, called MIW-L. MIW is based on industry standard open 32-bit architecture with intelligent controllers to manage multimedia devices. The first example of MIW is the CP486 workstation available from Olivetti. It is expected that other partners of MULTIWORKS will develop different versions of it with compatible architectures. MIW-L is built around a highly integrated low cost workstation based on the ARM RISC processor developed by Acorn (UK). Both versions will be able to support the same operating software and applications.

MULTIWORKS provides:
a peripheral subsystem of intelligent controllers that manage the new multimedia devices;
enhanced user interfaces, including new interaction devices usch as voice input and electronic paper;
Unix operating system enhanced with real time features to handle multimedia;
a consistent object oriented programming environment for the development of traditional applications that use the new media;
a set of authoring tools based on hypertext and expert systems.

The combination of these features with advances in user interface design will produce a significant increase in user friendliness and thus usability of the system compared with products currently on the market.
This multimedia technology is just emerging in some specialised products. It is foreseen that a high volume market will develop by 1994. Since the results of MULTIWORKS will be available in 1992, there will be enough time for the industrial partners to evaluate them and incorporate some of the MULTIWORKS components in their multimedia products. 

MULTIWORKS will be based on European technology and comply with international standards. Full use will be made of high-performance European hardware and design-on-silicon techniques. MULTIWORKS also uses European technology for its operating system, AI environment and applications. The project has a good mix of large and small companies. It is planned to last 4 years with significant results becoming available as spin-offs to the companies involved throughout the duration of the project, rather than just at its end.";;;;;Ingegneria C.

The aim of this project is to develop a broadband customer premises network (BCPN) suitable for broadband service providers and for a wide range of other corporate applications. Work on this project concentrates on system aspects, but includes development of the enabling technology where suitable devices are not available elsewhere. A test bed is being constructed to verify system design concepts and to test the technology involved.
A complete optical path has been publicly demonstrated carrying digital television signals at 155 Mbits{-1} and a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) at 2.5 Gbits{-1}. 2.5 Gbits{-1} laser transmitters at closely controlled wavelengths, 16-wavelength optical coupler, bulk optical demultiplexer, and 2.5 Gbits{-1} optical receivers fully characterized and within the optical power budget. Together, these demonstrate the practical feasibility of 4 nm wavelength spacing for 16 independent channels in a high density wavelength division multiplex (WDM) configuration. The diode coupled optical demultiplexer configuration has also proved successful.
A control system (node controller) for customer premises network (CPN) internal routeing has been demonstrated and interfaced with system test bed.
Research has progressed, with components developed for a planar waveguide coupler, and configurations determined for coupling an optical demultiplexer directly to a receiver array giving encouraging test results.
The equipment testbed layout has been finalised and hardware practice decided for 2.48 Gbits{-1} and 155 Mbits{-1} circuits.
Significant progress has been made in large scale integration (LSI) developments for time division multiplex (TDM) to synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) standards and design of a 2.5 Gbits{-} 12 x 12 expandable crosspoint switch matrix.
Technical Approach  

The BCPN will be capable of carrying signals at a wide range of bit-rates from low speed data signals up to high definition television (HDTV) using a combination of electrical time-division multiplexing (TDM) and optical wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM).  At each local routing centre (LRC), signals from the sources are time- multiplexed electronically to form a serial bit-stream at a up to 2.5 Gbit/s.  This serial signal modulates a distributed feedback (DFB) laser, and the outputs of all the LRCs (at slightly different wavelengths) are combined in an optical star coupler to give a WDM optical signal with a total payload capacity of over 38 Gbit/s.  The optical signal is redistributed to each of the LRCs where it is demultiplexed optically and electrically, without central switching.  An IBC 'T' interface will be specified to interconnect the BCPN and the public broadband network. Several different configurations of the system are possible to suit different applications.  

Work on this project concentrates on system aspects, but includes development of the enabling technology where suitable devices are not available elsewhere.  A test bed is being constructed to verify system design concepts and to test the technology involved.

A one year feasibility study, funded under the TELEMAN programme in the first phase of this project, demonstrated the concepts which enable digital photogrammetric systems to create CAD models of process plant items. The objective of the continuation of this feasibility study was to develop these concepts into a prototype system which could be subjected to a number of realistic trials by operators of nuclear facilities including British Nuclear Fuels, Electricite de France and Nuclear Electric. There were to be four principal objectives to the project: 
- Enhancement of HAZMAP software (HAZMAP II); 
- Trial of HAZMAP II; 
- Development of a 'free space' command and control system; 
- Coupling of the camera module with a light mobile robotic vehicle. 
A 1-year feasibility study, demonstrated the concepts which enable digital photogrammetric systems to create computer aided design (CAD) models of process plant items. The resulting concepts have been integrated into a prototype system to be tested by operators of nuclear facilities. 

The participation of end users has been canvassed with respect to the design and implementation of a pragmatic solution to the problems of plant owners, operators, and engineers. The solution has been submitted to trials in a range of industrial applications including: 
remotely controlled delivery to an inaccessible area at the British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing facility; 
accuracy testing in comparison with manual surveying techniques at an Electricite de France pressurized water reactor (PWR) plant under construction in Northern France; 
operation in high levels of radiation and very restricted and remote measurement of the Nuclear Electric Sizewell A reactor core. 

The third example was added to the initially planned test schedule and was a vital part of a major maintenance intervention which required the verification of a CAD model of the internals of a Magnox reactor on an operational power plant. This trial confirmed the practicality of using the system in earnest in a real nuclear environment and according to tight deadlines. 

The many suggestions from the plant operators have been incorporated. The result is a digital photogrammetry system which, for the first time, gives process engineers direct access to state of the art measurement techniques. This contrasts with the current reliance of end users on out sourcing of the entire responsiblity for as built survey operations to specialist contractors. 

The mounting of the HAZMAP unit on the Kentree mobile vehicle has demonstrated how the system might be deployed in a relatively open area. Using a space communication network the robot and camera surveillance unit can be controlled without the requirement for an umbilical cable.
Exploitaion
On-going work within the TM45 - IMPACT project will build upon the work on the building blocks developed in this project to offer greater functionality and robustness. University College London has spun out a small company, As-Built Solutions Ltd, which will seek to exploit the IPR developed within TM29. As part of this exploitation a number of client-funded trials have been undertaken in Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and USA. These trials demonstrate that the techniques are not only applicable to the nuclear industry but are also of great value to other process industries.
Work to be done 

Enhancement of HAZMAP software (HAZMAP II) 

The existing HAZMAP software was to be enhanced to provide further computer assistance to a CAD operator. Photogrammetric modifications were to include the automation of camera colibration, the improvement of the functional camera model, a stereo viewing capability and an enhanced coordinate geometry library. The system was to be based on an industry standard UNIX workstation and implemented under Xwindows. Camera hardware was to be based upon the pan/tilt unit developed under TM29 feasibility project. 

Trial of HAZMAP II 

UCL hardware and software was to be tested in simulated (non-radioactive) operating environments. Interfaces were to be developed to link HAZMAP II to IGRIP and PDMS CAD modelling tools. 

Development of a 'free space' command and control system 

Loughborough University in association with Kentree Ltd were to enhance the control system of an existing light mobile robot to test communication via a line-of-sight laser or microwave linkage. This novel system was intended to demonstrate the utility of such a strategy, enabling the free roving vehicle to operate without the constraints of an umbilical cord.  

Coupling of the camera module with a light mobile robotic vehicle  Subject to the satisfactory completion of the trials in the second objective, the camera module was to be mounted upon a modified Hobo robot vehicle supplied by Kentree Ltd. Further trials were to be carried out in laboratory conditions to evaluate the HAZMAP concept under simulated remote operating conditions using existing communication technology.   

Test strategy

As part of the work technical and usability trials will be completed to test key assumptions relevant to the distributed European publishing environment. 
The aim of the research was to create a distributed multimedia publishing environment which will enable a wide range of publishing services to proliferate in the 1990s. These services will be provided in the context of the evolving communications infrastructure anticipated. Key issues in the research included:
publishing standardization;
usage requirements;
infrastructure evolution;
economics.

Following the receipt and interpretation of requirements from publishers in diverse markets throughout Europe, pragmatic publishing and communications specifications have been defined. A base of technoeconomic information has been compiled and this was considered a vital prerequisite for translating functional system designs into real designs. Scenarios for application pilots themselves have been defined and evaluated. These results have permitted completion of the design and specification for the chosen pilot. Interim services have been designed and implemented, to test compound document handling, information reuse and colour picture transmission. Definition of a distributed published architecture has also been completed.
Technical Approach  

The project is based on a highly coordinated interpretation of users' requirements and a technical review of the relevant enabling technologies.  

Analysis of application scenarios will guide the choice of architecture for the DIMPE pilots.  Constraints are expected from the need to modify some peripheral publishing equipment, to support available telecommunications services.  The actual design of the DIMPE architecture was completed in the third year of work.  In conjunction with this, application standards were also agreed and promoted within the project.  This is judged a key activity in the process of removing barriers to the future proliferation of publishing services.  

The application pilot will include cooperative experiments planned for two major publishing sites in at least two member states.  The principles and benefits of remote editorial activities will be explored with a view to local customisation of newspapers and magazines.  This may lead to Europe-wide publishing operations, in the future.

A base of techno-economic information has been compiled; this considered a vital prerequisite for translating functional system designs into real designs.  Scenarios for the application pilots themselves have been defined and evaluated  These results have permitted completion of the design and specification for the chosen pilot.  Necessary modifications to existing publishing equipment are now underway.  

Interim services have been designed and implemented, to test compound document handling, information reuse and colour picture transmission.  Definition of a distributed publishing architecture has also been completed.  

As part of the promotional activities the project has also produced a brochure, made a number of presentations at conferences and has attracted considerable editorial comment in the media.  During 1992 the achievements and visibility will be exploited to maximum effect.

-compare learning and control of systems with various characteristics 
-compare learning by people with various strategies and attitudes 
-compare various methods of testing and assessing knowledge after training 
-examine the benefits and limits of acquired knowledge when used in new situations 
-construct an improved conceptual framework based on these findings 
-state the impact of the findings upon applications.
The way that human beings learn and perform when in control of complex systems was studied. Complex systems are those involving a number of variables which show dynamic changes even in the absence of any decision by the operator. The programme of work focussed on the benefit or harm that may arise if experience in 1 situation is followed by performance in a slightly different one. The method is experimental and aims to produce a more integrated conceptual framework than hitherto.

The aims of the project were to:
compare learning and control of systems with various characteristics;
compare learning by people with various strategies and attitudes;
compare various methods of testing and assessing knowledge after training;
examine the benefits and limits of acquired knowledge when used in new situations;
construct an improved conceptual framework based on these findings;
state the impact of the findings upon applications.

The project used a predominantly experimental approach, implemented by constructing tasks and asking people to perform them. The 5 partners exchangedtasks and methods of measurement, and each applied them in a somewhat different field. The purpose was to avoid drawing conclusions from a narrow situation.

Experiments were undertaken on the control of abstract systems with no apparent connection to past experience, but also on reasonably realistic simulations of the mixing of asphalt, or of the control of a patient's physiological functions in an intensive care unit. One of the topics of study was the benefit found when a person gains experience in a realistic situation but then has to control an unfamiliar one with the same formal structure.

Comparisons were made of graphical and linguistic ways of presenting information about the structure of a task, and of the relative merits of attempting to succeed in the task, of monitoring the control of a system by a mechanical device, and of freely exploring the system with no obligation to do well.

The problems examined were chosen so as to shed light on the set of principles governing the human control of dynamic systems.

PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The experimental work was completed in October 1991, and the final six months of the Action were spent in integrating the theoretical and applied conclusions of the whole Action. The final report (March 1992) contains a statement of the unified view that has reulted. Academic publications are now being prepared by the various partners. 
Briefly, performance of system control must involve some representation, inside the person, of knowledge about the system. But, successful control can result from alternative sub-sets of knowledge. In particular, it can be lacking in structural knowledge about the system, and confined to knowledge of appropriate actions. That knowledge may benefit from the provision of a decision-advice system, from feedback about the success of action, and indeed from action rather than observation. For transfer to new problems, however, such a knowledge-base is less effective than a more structural representation. This is favoured by teaching principles, by displaying more task information than the minimum needed for performance. The importance of these points becomes greater as the system becomes more complex, and (regarding it as a finite-state automaton) capable of entering more states. 
POTENTIAL 
Chemical plants, power stations, and transport systems all provide examples of situations in which people attempt to intervene in complex dynamic systems. In each there is an increasing need for assistance and advice for the human operator; potentially, that need can be met by technology. If this advice is to be effective, however, it is imperative to better understand the nature of human decisions.";;;;;THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;UK;"VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;Universität Bayreuth;UNIVERSITÄT DER BUNDESWEHR;Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn";"BE;DE";

Until recently, the various telecommunications services have used different networks and equipment. Thus text might be sent by telex, and the spoken word by telephone. At the time of the project, there had been little attempt to combine these services together. Thanks to digital transmission and switching, we are now starting to see a variety of audiovisual services which combine sound communication, pictures and text in a number of ways. So that these terminals can interwork, however, it is important that a standard framework is provided which describes how the signals are combined and controlled. This framework is generally known as the conversational audiovisual service infrastructure. 

The main objective of MIAS has been the further development of this signal and protocol infrastructure, building on the results already achieved in this area by the preceding project 1057-MIAC. The adoption of such an infrastructure as a European and world-wide standard is enabling the successful introduction of terminals and services based on these concepts.

The project aims to develop standardized facilities to support system engineering activities. These facilities will comprise a framework and integrated tools and services that will form a basis for the development of application specific integrated system engineering environments.

The definition phase of the project has produced a study of system engineering that takes the literature and the current state of practice within the members of the consortium into account. This study attempted to define a common system engineering model suitable for a wide range of application domains. A complementary study was carried out to define a rationale for the various methods and tools proposed for use within the advanced techniques and models of system productions in a heterogeneous, extensible and rigorous environment (ATMOSPHERE) project. In addition, the definition phase of ATMOSPHERE has concluded that there are 2 complementary approaches to environment integration: a framework driven or architecture driven approach, based on the use of a preselected integration framework and a method or toolset driven approach, based on more loosely coupled communication oriented mechanisms. The development phase of ATMOSPHERE is organized in such a way that it starts from the current state of practice, within the partners' organizations, of automated support for the system engineering process (in terms of system engineering tools and methods as well as integration approaches) in order to progressively consolidate and standardise a common system engineering approach (process models and methods) and a set of complementary environment integration techniques.
ATMOSPHERE is targeted to support system engineering for applications in IT covering switching, manufacturing, office and embedded systems. 

A standards-based approach will be followed throughout. Existing standards (industrial, national and international) will be adopted in the development of the ATMOSPHERE framework, tools, services and interfaces, though it is expected that these standards will be adapted, through exploitation and marketing activities, to enable them to encompass a wider range of interrelated technologies.";;;;;CAP Gemini Innovation;FR;"Ministry of Defence (MOD);GEC Marconi Ltd;CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY;Software Sciences Ltd;TELESOFT AB;GIE-EMERAUDE;SERC;Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG;NOKIA CORPORATION;STICHTING VOOR MATEMATISCH CENTRUM - CENTRUM VOOR WISKUNDE & INFORMATICA;SIEMENS AG;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET KAISERSLAUTERN;Advanced Mechanics and Engineering Ltd;E2S - EXPERT SOFTWARE SYSTEMS;COMPUTER RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL;Bull Italia SpA;COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY CO.;AEG Olympia AG;ESF;GESELLSCHAFT FÜR ELEKTRONISCHE INFORMATIONSVERARBEITUNG;GENERICS SOFTWARE;Intecs Sistemi SpA;TELELOGIC AB;UNIVERSITY OF LIMERICK;NEDERLANDSE PHILIPS BEDRIJVEN BV;INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIA DE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES;UNIVERSITY OF STRATHCLYDE;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN;Bull SA;Datamat Ingegneria dei Sistemi SpA;Sema Group SA;Société Française de Génie Logiciel SA;UNIVERSITAET - GESAMTHOCHSCHULE PADERBORN;Sema Group plc;Universität Dortmund;University of Brighton";"UK;SE;FR;NL;DE;FI;BE;DK;IT;EL;IE;PT";

8606;2455;LIT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Large-Image Terminals;01/01/1989;31/12/1991;;"The partners in this project have noted the growing demand for programmable large-screen video displays for use in a wide variety of applications including training, retailing, teleconferencing, notice boards, point-of-sale terminals and map displays. The performance requirements for such devices may be summarised as: 

- a large screen image in compact system cabinet 
- facilities to allow the user to interact easily with the system via, for example, touch screens and pointing devices. 

The main aim of the LIT project is to produce a demonstrator which meets these needs.

Back-projection of liquid crystal displays is the chosen display technology. Development work on this aspect of the system will centre on producing high-resolution LCDs and an ultra-compact, distortion-free projection system which is expected to be lighter and less bulky than the conventional projection CRT systems. 

The technology required to realise the interactive screen has been defined after human factors studies in the early phases of the programme. 

The architecture of the system will be designed in such a manner that a remote link could be incorporated at a later stage. 

Two working units will be produced: one will be a prototype feasibility demonstrator as close as possible to a final product, aimed at the training and retailing market; the other will be used for assessment purposes. 

An important feature of the project is the use of human-computer interaction methodology throughout, to optimise user-friendliness and versatility and with the aim of minimising future iterations in the product design. 

The range of potential applications for these types of terminals can be expected to be widened with the use of remote communication links (not planned in this phase) such as radio, ISDN, mains-borne, infrared and telephone. A significant market is expected to develop in the next 10 years for remotely programmable terminals.

-Encourage new axes of communication to form across consortia boundaries, thus stimulating new areas of collaboration and new research initiatives. 
-Help create and strengthen a wider European community of researchers concerned with problems of cognition and language.
The project coordinated and stimulated scientific cooperation between European research centres involved in studying the question of how information is encoded in and extracted from discourse.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The key questions addressed by the Working Group were organised around the following topics: 
-Questions and answers: what constitutes an appropriate answer to a given question? Can the process of integrating newly conveyed information with discourse-specific or domain knowledge be described as a process of cognitive questioning? 
-Focus, topic, comment and presupposition: does the topic-comment structure of discourse reflect this process of cognitive questioning? What is the relation between topicality and presupposition? 
-Intonation: how is the given/new and the topic/comment structure of discourse marked intonationally? 
-Text coherence: what are the processing implications of explicit markers of text coherence? When a text seems to lack  coherence, to what extent can extra material be accommodated in the discourse model to produce a coherent interpretation? 
-Lexical semantics: how can words be stored in such a way that they can interact with the information emanating from preceding discourse, in generation as well as understanding? 
To increase collaboration on these issues, DANDI provided a framework for visits to other research sites, the organisation of workshops and special interest groups, and the exchange of research results. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
DANDI supports collaboration between existing research teams. The achievements, publications and potential for exploitation of the Working Group should be seen in this light.

Highly ordered materials are made from organic chemical compounds. The name 'molecular materials' is used in order to distinguish them from the commonly used semi-conductive inorganic materials. 
The Action has focused on the construction of molecules which can be switched between two metastable states primarily activated by electromagnetic irradiation. The switch molecules contain electron donor and acceptor groups connected by a linker. Molecular structures with mobile electrons serving as connecting wires were also studied. The specification and design of the molecules is performed with the assembly of highly ordered stable systems in mind.
Organic materials with potential transistor-like switching properties have been designed and prepared. Donor and acceptor structures of, respectively, the TTF and bianthrone type were prepared and synthesic methods developed for attaching linkers for combining donors and acceptors. Hydrocarbon chains of various lengths were attached to the donor and acceptor groups to allow mono and multilayer films to be prepared by the Langmuir Blodgett technique of the combined molecular switch (molswitch) molecule. A donor acceptor system based on bianthrone has been demonstrated to act as a molswitch in solution. In films inactive due to steric hindrance, the obstacle is overcome by addition of spacers in the films. Donor and acceptor modified polyenes with different chain lengths have been prepared with benzoid donors and acceptors. Synthesis was achieved of symmetrical and polarised molecular wires based on caroviologens, with the molecules incorporated in artificial lipid membranes. Electron transfer by binding of inorganic ions was demonstrated. Equipment for picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy was constructed. Picosecond and nanosecond time-resolved spectroscopy was carried out on molswitch molecules, yielding information on the charge transfer process. A redox sensor system with flourescence readout was synthesised and studied. Theoretical evaluation by quantum chemical calculations of the stability of polaron and exiton transport mechanisms in polyene chains was performed. Calculations of electronic properties for the ground state and lowest singlet and triple excited state of molecular switches have been performed and compared with experimental results. A good agreement was found between the calculations and the experiments.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Different types of switching mechanisms for blocking the back-flow of electrons were investigated. Blocking of the back-flow of electrons was attempted by a change in conformation. Blocking in both directions was attempted by switching a bistable group inserted between the donor and the acceptor group in a molecular triad. Both types of switches were activated by electromagnetic radiation. A third type of switching mechanism was based upon ion complexation. 
Chemical synthesis of potentially switching molecules includes the preparation of TTF-like donors connected to bianthrone acceptors by electronically partly delocalised linkers, mixed valence caroviologen molecules and long-chain polyenes substituted by benzoid donors with simple electron-attracting groups at the chain terminals. 
The properties of the molecules are evaluated by spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. Ground- and excited-state properties were calculated and the results used to adjust the designs of the types of molecules mentioned above. 
The techniques used for preparing highly ordered materials are film formation by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, membrane formation, and epitaxial growth. The structure and stability of the material were investigated by methods such as spectroscopy and X-ray techniques. 
The transport and switching properties were evaluated by spectroscopic, electrical and electrochemical techniques, pico- and nano-second, time-resolved spectroscopy and chemical measurements. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The Action has lead to a strongly increased insight into the basic requirements for a molecular switch. 
-Donor and acceptor structures of, respectively, the TTF and bianthrone type were prepared and synthesic methods developed for attaching linkers for combining donors and acceptors. 
-Hydrocarbon chains of various lengths were attached to the donor and acceptor groups to allow mono and multilayer films to be prepared by the Langmuir Blodgett technique of the combined molswitch molecule. 
-A donor-acceptor system based on bianthrone has been demonstrated to act as a molswitch in solution. However, in fims inactive due to steric hindrance, the obstacle is overcome by addition of spacers in the films.

POTENTIAL 
An increase in knowledge about the behaviour of electrons in organic compounds and materials is a prerequisite for the exploitation of the tremendous potential of molecular materials in applications such as sensor technology and computer and communication devices.

The project represents an extensive pool of expertise and research experience, ranging from advanced techniques in speech analysis and production through language modelling and robust parsing to sophisticated dialogue and discourse representation.
ELSNET represent an extensive pool of expertise and research experience, ranging from advanced techniques in speech analysis and production through language modeling and robust parsing to sophisticated dialogue and discourse representation. During the first year of its life , it has begun to be recognized as an important actor in scientific, infrastructure and research planning initiatives within Europe and has established valuable links with corresponding actors in countris outside Europe. 

The Network's main activities are organised around four Task Groups concerned with Research Coordination, Training and Mobility, Linguistic and Speech Resources and Industrial Links: more information about these can be obtained from the coordinator. In addition to the 38 Associate Nodes and 47 Industrial Affiliates, there are 9 Managing Nodes with particular responsibility for their respective countries, and these also provide important access points to the Networks. 

The Networks encourages participation from teams in academic and industrial research laboratories in both EC and EFTA countries.

8763;5473;PAYDIRT;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Processing Architecture Yielding Deductions in Real Time;01/11/1990;31/10/1993;;"PAYDIRT has built the key tools for developing real-time knowledge based systems applications. 
The Paydirt project aims to develop and validate an architecture for real time knowledge based systems (RTKBS). This architecture is particularly focussed on problems of control room process control. The project specifically addresses the issues of:
guaranteed response time (GRT);
temporal reasoning mechanisms (TRM);
continuous data flow;
dynamic task priorities and scheduling;
modulated data aquisition;
the inference engine structures best adapted to these constraints. An important aspect of the project has been the drive to produce modules that can be completely embedded within existing applications.

The architecture and its component modules are validated by 2 different prototypes being developed within the project. The first deals with the problems of electrical network demand management (load balancing). The second handles crisis management in a waste water and storm drain network. It is felt that 2 different applications help guarantee the generic nature of the processing architecture.

It was felt that the best way to handle RTKBS problems was to develop an overall architecture composed of different tools, each with a different role. The result is a multilevel system designed from the ground up to handle data from online systems. All tools use the same underlying description language, Paydirt object oriented language (POOL), all are written in C\\ and run under UNIX SVR4. There is a sophisticated, offline knowledge base compiler that permits declarative description and generates procedural code where desirable.

The system is composed of 4 different types of processes which communicate through a shared object memory (SOM) which can be seen as a partitioned blackboard. The processes are:
scheduler;
generic interface (GI);
reactive reasoning;
high level reasoning.
The development environment is built on Unix-based workstations and developed in C\\. The main topics are: 

- time-dependent reasoning in real time 
- object-based approach 
- parallel inference engine 
- rule language 
- procedural control 
- dynamic scheduling. 

The run-time system is placing minimal requirements on the host operating system to maximise its portability. It is capable of both calling external routines and being called by them. This is in accordance with the aim to build a system that is suitable for embedding within other systems (typically supervisory control and data-acquisition systems). 

Emphasis has been placed on run-time issues rather than development ones, with the aim of producing a truly real-time knowledge-based system. The key issues of interruptability, guaranteed response times, and temporal reasoning are addressed within a system with high performance and good representational adequacy. 

The development of this system is driven by two applications to ensure that the requirements from these applications are satisfied by the tool development. The tools are being validated against requirements both from functional perspective and from performance perspective. This validation will shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the tools and assist in the identification of the optimisation possibilities.";;;;;SOCIETE LYONNAISE DES EAUX;FR;"ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GMBH;Lloyds Register of Shipping;SINAPSE";"DE;UK;FR";

In both system design and components development, techniques will be developed for high-level integration and low power consumption. The workstation will support multimedia input/output which will include handwriting, speech and conventional computer formats. System software will be based on a standard Unix interface, and an MS/DOS emulation package will be ported. 

TELESTATION will have good communications facilities through integrating both DECT (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications) and GSM (Groupe Special Mobile) into a portable workstation. This will involve the development of standard interfaces (both hardware and software) which can be used as the basis for further work and standardisation contributions. The GSM/(DECT) unit will be no bigger than a satchel. 

TELESTATION will support a multimedia user interface. Some media translation will be provided, such as the development and integration of speech and handwriting recognition. In future greater media interchange should be possible, and the project will work towards standards for such interchanges. 

Telecommuting (working at home, with efficient communications links to the office) is likely to become much more popular in the near future. TELESTATION will develop a distributed cooperative computing environment with multimedia support as a mechanism to enable effective telecommuting.

The objective of the bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor (BICMOS) project has been the development of a very large scale integration (VLSI) technology combining, on a single chip, high density complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry with bipolar circuitry of similar density, but better suited to specific tasks, such as analogue interfacing with the external world. The main effort has been on the technological side, in the development of methods which allow both bipolar and CMOS transistors to be made in compatible process steps, and in dimensions comparable to those obtained in CMOS-only technology. In parallel with the technological work, design methods for this specific type of circuit (mixing analogue and digital functions) have been under development, along with studies to determine for various types of application, the most appropriate division of subsystems between the 2 circuit technologies.
A BICMOS-2 (1.2 micron feature size in CMOS and 0.9 to 1.2 micron in the bipolar part) has been developed. A bipolar transit frequency of 10 GHz has been achieved. Isolated vertical pnp transistors have been incorporated for analogue applications. A number of circuits have been designed and processed.
They include: a 10-bit video analogue to digital (AD) converter with 13.5 MHz sampling rate and over 100 k complexity for a total chip size of 80 mm{-2}; a 2k emitter coupled logic (ECL) gate array with a 16k static random access memory (SRAM); a finite impulse response (FIR) filter for application in high definition television (HDTV) and 8-bit AD converter for a data rate of 75 MHz and including an antialiasing filter; a 200 kHz, 16 bit AD converter (30-50k complexity) with error correction and autocalibration.

The application of metrics in industry (AMI) project intends to demonstrate the maturity and applicability of metrics technology to the industrial software community. A coherent set of real industrial software projects has been identified and supplied with a strategy for selecting, applying and reporting project measurements. The strategy will be optimized to guarantee rapid installation, fast feedback within projects and widespread applicability. The results of implementing this strategy combined with feedback from other projects will be the main inputs for the AMI major deliverable: the Metrics User's Handbook. This handbook will be a progressive guide on how to customize, install and apply the AMI metrics model. It will incorporate information on metrics standards and metrics teaching within the Community. The method used in the handbook demonstrates that starting form a quality goal, metrics can be implemented. The goal quality metrics (GQM) method from the software engineering institute (SEI) is efficient and is complementary to previous research and development activities which aimed to make intensive data collections and then analyze them.

The use of the AMI handbook and the associated AMI method has been demonstrated in 19 projects drawn from a variety of different industries. These include business systems, clerical systems, real time embedded systems, safety critical firmware, avionics systems, transport systems, telecommunications and simulators. The projects have shown that the AMI method and the AMI handbook are endorsed by industrial users and that the method enables software measurement to be implemented in an effective and efficient manner.

The AMI method is complementary to previous research and development activities and is mainly concerned with the establishment and running of a metrics programme, and makes use of results from these and other projects. The handbook has now been professionally formatted and published. Further material has now been professionally formatted and published. Further material is being produced that will provide support to implementers of measurement programmes using the AMI method. This will include AMI case studies, metric promoters' guide, a personal computer (PC) based AMI tool, and training in the use and application of the AMI method.

KIWIS will provide an integrated knowledge-representation language and programming environment for user modification, and establish an open environment with extensible, friendly graphical interfaces to distributed databases and knowledge bases. The KIWIS system will connect to external, traditional database systems, and give a complex-object view of their data. It will also establish a cooperating network environment consisting of distributed knowledge-based systems, by enabling an intelligent dialogue with other KIWIS systems. 

The KIWIS system architecture will support a persistent knowledge representation language, LOCO, based on object-oriented and logic programming paradigms, that will be tightly integrated. The architecture will be composed of a number of layers that incrementally add power to the system, thus providing both low-level facilities (eg, for the storage and manipulation of persistent complex objects in central and in secondary memory), and sophisticated operators to implement every feature of the language.

-Compare results derived from different proposed mechanisms (including the conventional theory of superconductivity) and experimental observations. 
-Modify existing theories to account for the different parameter regions observed in high-temperature superconductors, and study the consequences of these modifications for the experiments. 
-Construct, out of these results, realistic multibody models of the microscopic interactions present in the superconducting solid materials, and approach them by using the most recently developed numerical methods.
A unified superconductivity theory and an understanding of the basic microscopic physical mechanisms that lead to high temperature superconductivity is sought. The following results will help in the creation of improved superconducting materials:
undoped and weakly doped Mott and Peierls insulator viewpoint (2-dimensional lattice, destruction of long range antiferromagnetic order by doping, spin polarons and spiral phases);
nonmagnetic mechanisms for superconductivity in the strongly doped region (strong coupling theories, polaronic and bipolaronic superconductivity, effects due to reduced dimensionality or more realistic band structures, fluctuations effects on temperature, flux lattices and pinning centres);
magnetic mechanisms for superconductivity in the strongly doped region;
computational approaches (quantum Monte-Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization of small clusters of Hubbard models).
APPROACH AND METHODS 
Theorists from diverse fields, ranging from pure solid-state physics to statistical mechanics, and from quantum field theory to numerical modelling, are brought together to work in groups. Periodic mixing of the groups enables the continuous confrontation of the different approaches, techniques and results, and a thorough exchange of information. The Action included meetings of the participant theorists with experimentalists, which is ideal for the comparison of theoretical results and predictions with ex perimental observations, and the foundation of new experiments. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The following results have been achieved: 
-Undoped and weakly doped Mott and Peierls insulator viewpoint. 2-D Heisenberg lattice, destruction of long range antiferromagnetic order by doping, spin polarons and spiral phases. 
-Non-magnetic mechanisms for superconductivity in the strongly doped region. Strong coupling theories, polaronic and bipolaronic superconductivity, effects due to reduced dimensionality or more realistic band structures, fluctuations effects on temperatu re, flux lattices and pinning centres. 
-Magnetic mechanisms for superconductivity in the strongly doped region. Short-range magnetic fluctuations, RVB approach, flux phases and anyons. 
-Computational approaches. Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations and exact diagonalisation of small clusters of Hubbard models. 
POTENTIAL 
This Action will lead to a better understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for high-temperature superconductivity. Its success will provide material scientists, physicists and chemists with a novel insight into the structure and behaviour of new superconductors, indispensable for making progress in the production of materials with improved characteristics.

In the course of the project, all those elements identified as having significant risk have been addressed and suitable solutions developed.
Full automation of all relevant scanning electron microscope (SEM) functions to match fabline requirements have been demonstrated.

There are four subgroups, covering:

-III-V compound electro-optic devices 
-free-space optical interconnect technology 
-architectures, systems and algorithms.
The status of optical information technology is reviewed to identify collaboration opportunities and key areas where research is needed. A clear picture of the future direction of optical information processing is emerging and gives rise to a major research proposal.

Progress was reviewed in the 4 main topic areas. Investigations of thermal optical nonlinearities of II to VI semiconductors has led to the construction of a novel temperature sensor, based on the optical bistability of cadmium sulphide. Other cadmium sulphide optical properties are being investigated as a route to directly cascadable devices in the short time (picosecond) regime. Molecular beam deposition work has enabled the preparation of nonlinear interference filters of good uniformity that exhibit high resistance to laser beam damage. The performance of such filters in various optical processing circuits is being assessed.

Assembly of data has continued for a review of Perspectives for Parallel Optical Interconnects, a forthcoming publication which will include state of the art contributions.

Progress has been made on many issues, including optical pipeline processors, fast arithmetic using optical symbolic substitution logic, tolerancing studies, development of the optical cellular logic image processor and an edge detection cellular automation. A demonstration of optical most significant digit addition has also been staged.

Pump and probe beam and luminescence spectroscopy were used to study the nonlinear response of gallium arsenide/(aluminium gallium) arsenide (GaAs/(AlGa)As) heterostructures to quasistationary excitation conditions. The carrier induced energetic shift of the 1hh-exciton as a function of the quantum well width showed a dimensional dependence of the carrier screening properties. This shift gave a good criterion to decide whether a system behaved more like a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional systems. The high excitation regime was dominated by electron-hole plasma features. Many particle effects led to a renormalization of the fundamental bandgap. This effect was essential for understanding the physics of III-V semiconductor lasers. The carrier density and the reduced bandgap were determined via systematic evaluation of both gain and luminescence spectra. The observed behaviour can be described by a strict 2-dimensional theory using effective exciton parameters in order to account for the finite well widths of the structures. The study of the higher sub-bands revealed that both exciton bleaching and sub-band renormalization were mainly due to direct occupation of the specific sub-band while intersub-band effects were considerably smaller. By coating the 2 sides of a 50 by 100 Angstron multiple quantum well with semitransparent chromium-gold (Cr-Au) electrodes it was possible to control the energetic position of the 1hh-exciton as a function of the applied electric field and of the incoming light power. Several structures to optimize this effect in order to build an electrooptical switch or modulator was outlined.

The way the quantum confined Stark effect for asymmetric step quantum wells depends on specific quantum well parameters (total well width, width ratio, step height) has been studied. The calculations were performed for wells consisting of one layer of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and one layer of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlxGa(1-x)As) and barrier layers of aluminium gallium arsenide (Al0.3Ga0.7As). The energy levels and wave functions were calculated using the transfer matrix method. 

The largest field induced shifts of the effective bandgap were obtained for the widest quantum wells. For wells of a total thickness of 75 Angstroms and an aluminium concentration in the potential step of 6%, the largest shifts were obtained for wells where 20% of the width consisted of gallium arsenide. For wells having a 15 Angstrom thick gallium arsenide layer and a 60 Angstrom wide aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) potential step. The largest energy level shifts were obtained for aluminium concentrations between 12% and 18%. 

Barrier reservoir and quantum well electron transfer (BRAQWET) structures were also studied. For BRAQWETs consisting of gallium arsenide reservoir layers, 3 strained indium gallium arsenide wells and aluminium gallium arsenide barrier layers. The product of the voltage to obtain a pi phase change times the length of the waveguide could be 0.25 Vmm, which is 10 times less than has been reported for any other semiconductor structure.

A novel, efficient and fast vertical nin aluminium gallium arsenide/gallium arsenide (AlGaAs/GaAs) multiple quantum well (MQW) microresonator grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been demonstrated. The electrical current of this hybrid device is kept low by using undoped aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) barrier layers cladding the active MQW material. For high speed operation, a novel travelling wave modulator with a special coplanar metallic waveguide structure has been proposed. Electrooptical modulation was studied using a titanium:sapphire (Ti:sapphire) laser pumped by an argon ion laser.

Nonlinear Fabry-Perot (NLFP) devices have been fabricated which operate at a threshold power 1 mW with a contrast ratio of about 10:1 and less than 1 dB attenuation. The absorbed switching energy is about 4 pJ in the NLFP. Due to critical slowing down this figure is independent of the transition time, which can vary from a few ns to us, depending on the magnitude of the switching signal used. The threshold power, together with the dissipated switching energy, corresponds to an estimated GBWP of 100 MHz. The suitability of these gallium arsenide (GaAs) etalons as integrating/threshold units has been investigated theoretically. Due to the wavelength selectivity of the resonant structure, the device should be used with stabilized laser systems, until adequate frequency stability and tunability is achieved with semiconductor lasers. These devices have minimal spatial fan-in capacity. The trend in NLFP devices is towards shorter, higher finesse cavities, to reduce the switching intensity. However, because of the limited optical confinement provided by the integrated dielectric mirrors, diffraction losses become increasingly important for shorter cavities. Calculations for devices based on aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) material indicate that the switching energy tends to saturate at an asymptotic value of about 0.1 pJ for finesse values larger than Fc about 100. To eliminate diffraction losses and to improve the switching energy, it is necessary to use waveguiding. Such devices will accept a single spatial mode, and their temporal fan-in will decrease proportionally with finesse, beyond Fe. At present, arrays containing about 1000 devices on an area of less than 1 square millimetre are conceivable.

In synthetic diffractive optics, the sensitivity of the resonance domain designs to the fabrication errors can be estimated by introducing random perturbations to the optimized parameters. The deviations from the optimized groove structure increase the reconstruction error. Numerical simulations show that the inaccuracy of the transition points should not exceed one twentieth of the wavelength for satisfactory performance. Therefore, the present day microlithographic fabrication methods restrict the demonstrations to infrared wavelengths. 

Two reflection type resonance domain fan-out gratings were fabricated for wavelength 10.6 um. The fabrication method guarantees almost perfect reflectivity at this wavelength. The reconstruction errors of the fabricated beamsplitters with fan-out to six and seven were 11% and 15%, compared to the design values 2.3% and 3.5%, agreeing roughly with the numerical analysis of fabrication errors, assuming that the transverse fabrication accuracy is 0.2 um. For normal incidence (and odd fan-out), the zeroth order is particularly sensitive to the fabrication errors of the groove depth. The relief depth error for the one to seven fan-out grating was about 1%, and the zeroth order was consequently weaker than the others. Excluding the zeroth order, a reconstruction error of 8% was measured for the remaining orders.

A technique for the reduction of the peak intensity of noise which arises from Fourier plane array generators has been developed. This is achieved by designing the array generator as a quasiperiodic computer generated hologram. In this way an even distribution of noise is obtained while the required diffraction orders are left as tightly sampled spots. Using the method of generalized error diffusion, several different quasiperiodic 4 x 4 array generators were designed. A 14.5 dB reduction in peak noise was obtained for a hologram with 8 x 8 quasiperiods. Diffraction efficiency and array uniformity were not adversely affected by this technique.

A microlens fabrication process has been developed, based on the fact that an irradiation of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with a high energy ion beam reduces the molecular weight by splitting the polymer chains and thus changes the diffusion properties of the material. Thus there are 2 processing steps, an irradiation and a subsequent diffusion. 

By irradiation of PMMA with a high energy proton beam through a structured metal mask, domains with reduced molecular weight are produced. For the fabrication of microlenses metal masks with circular apertures have to be used. 

After irradiation the structured substrate is placed into an atmosphere of monomer vapour. The diffusion of monomer vapour causes the volume of the irradiated domains to expand. By surface tension these volumes form lenslike shapes.

3-dimensional microoptic systems can be fabricated by a thermal imprinting processes in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Each microoptic component is constructed by thermally imprinting a metal master into the substrate. This process, though simple, provides high quality components and allows mass production. 

The possibility of free design of the components and their locations opens a wide range of optical applications. In particular, optical interconnections and microoptic elements for digital optical data processing systems can be made cost efficiently. Due to the refractive or reflective nature of the imprints, the angular sensitivity and the spectral sensitivity for transmitted or reflected light are significantly smaller as compared to diffractive interconnections. 

A mass production of imprinted structures is also possible by electroforming. To this end, the substrates can be coated with silver (Ag) or nickel (Ni) by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), resulting in a conducting surface. The thickness and stability of the metal layers is increased by electroforming of nickel. The PMMA substrates are then dissolved, eg by acetone. Consequently, a negative copy of the imprinted component arrangement can be achieved. This copy can be used later for thermally imprinting the whole scheme is one step. A reactive of thermal injection moulding may cause problems due to the shrinking during polymerization. With deep thermal imprinting, however, the distances can be maintained sufficiently.

A hybrid processor architecture for an associative memory with complex images has been developed, using double correlator architecture, where a reflective hologram on a BGO crystal gives the desired squared correlation which is back convolved with the memory images recorded on the first hologram. 

First experiments utilized invariant filters as fixed masks with a video input. A grating with the same spatial carrier as the filter was placed in front of the liquid crystal light valve (LCLV). Using a joint transform filter set up, image recording was demonstrated, but there were difficulties in aligning the LCLV and the photographic filter. With the matched filter configuration, implementation was easier, and the initial poor signal to noise ratio requires that the complex filters also be recorded on the LCLV.

Holographic and diffractive optical elements have been finding widespread use in parallel optical computing demonstration experiments. Three basic functions can be identified: 
high level fan-out (one to hundreds) of a single beam to provide the multiple inputs required to power logic planes containing arrays of optical logic elements; 
low level fan-out (one to a few) to provide regular interconnection patterns between elements within processing arrays (eg between nearest neighbours); 
irregular (space variant) interconnects across processing arrays. 

Holographic/diffractive techniques can satisfy a wide range of interconnect requirements within experimental optical computing systems. This remains a rapidly developing research area, with many new advances in sight, particularly in the context of surface relief diffractive optical elements. It can be anticipated that the optical processing systems of the future will rely on holographic fan-out/fan-in components of this sort, closely integrated into the compact optomechanical assemblies that are also currently under development.

Since the recognition of the importance of optical array illuminators in the construction of parallel digital optical processors, a wide variety of optical components have been designed and demonstrated that convert a single laser beam into a regularly spaced array of M x N equal intensity light spots. Space variant array illuminators, which form the spot array in a Fresnel plane or an image plane of the aperture, are in general easy to design and fabricate, but they require uniform plane wave illumination that is difficult to provide. Space invariant array illuminators generate the spot array in the Fourier plane and are therefore rather immune to the exact shape of the incident beam, but they are more difficult to design and require tight fabrication tolerances. 

Three techniques of achieving space invariant optical array illuminators by means of diffraction gratings with a computer synthesized periodic structure have been examined. The spot separation and the compression ratio in the Fourier plane can then be controlled straightforwardly by choosing a suitable grating period and the size of the illuminating beam, respectively. The relative intensities of the diffraction orders are, however, highly nonlinear functions of the grating structure, even in the domain where the paraxial scalar diffraction theory is valid. 

Binary and multilevel surface relief gratings fabricated directly on fused silica by microlithographic methods involving electron beam written masks and reactive ion etching have been examined. Additionally, the method of hybrid holography was applied to record (in dichromated gelatin) the object wave produced by spatially filtering the output of an electron beam written binary amplitude master grating. The potential and the limitations of these techniques have been compared quantitatively, using 32 x 1 array illuminators as an illustration. 

The binary gratings were the easiest to fabricate and, along with the multilevel elements, the easiest to use since they reconstruct the array on-axis. Of these 2, the multilevel approach offers higher efficiency but large scale fabrication requires low cost replication techniques. Hybrid holograms can be replicated by optical holography but the present recording material (dichromated gelatin) requires careful processing.

The prospect of wide bandgap light emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers has been transformed by recent advances in p-doping in materials such as zinc selenide (ZnSe) grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Junctions of p-n ZnSe on gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates using iodine as the n-type dopant and nitrogen from a plasma discharge source as the p-type dopant has been grown. LEDs have been fabricated using a gold contact to the p-type layer and blue continuous wave (CW) emission has been observed under forward bias. Stripe geometry laser structures have been fabricated and blue stimulated emission has been observed for the first time at low temperatures.

Electronic dispersive optical nonlinearities of cadmium sulphide (CdS) platelets have been investigated by wave mixing and pump probe experiments. These nonlinearities enabled the realization of a picosecond single wavelength. Fabry-Perot type logical gate that exploits polarization dichroism.

Coherent nonlinear resonances due to extended and localized excitons in cadmium selenide (CdSe) and cadmium selenide sulphide (CdSexS(1-x)) have been investigated by picosecond time resolved degenerate 4 wave mixing and differential transmission experiments. Large nonlinear coefficients chi(3) greater than 10 square centimetres per square volt were found, with coherence times in the picosecond range.

The nonlinear spectra of absorption near the band edge have been calculated for quantum well wires with up to 3 subbands. The calculations take into account phase space filling, plasma screening and band gap renormalization due to an optically excited electron-hole plasma. Large optical nonlinearities are obtained around the exciton ground state mainly due to state filling by the optically excited thermal electron-hole plasma, while the plasma screening effects are found to have relatively little influence. For all plasma densities n (including n = 0) the free carrier transition spectra differ strongly from those calculated with Coulomb interaction. 

The plasma density dependence of the spectra of absorption and dispersion of gallium arsenide/gallium aluminium arsenide (GaAs/GaAlAs) quantum well wires (QWWs) with up to 3 subbands has been calculated. These calculations are an extension of corresponding calculations for bulk and quantum will semiconductors which are generally in good agreement with corresponding measurements.

In pump and probe beam experiments on II-VI semiconductor quantum dots at room and helium temperature no holeburning was found, but a strong bleaching of both maxima in the absorption spectrum, up to 75% of the optical density under a pump intensity up to 60 MW per square centimetre. This bleaching was nearly independent of the pump energy and the resulting small energetic shift was identified with the inhomogeneous broadening due to the size distribution of the crystallite. For both temperatures the halfwidth of the bleaching peak was comparable, which suggests a strong coupling of the excited states to the lattice. Corresponding results were obtained also from linear luminescence measurements. From both a Huang-Rhys factor from 1 to 2 was calculated fro the system. The samples were investigated in a self diffraction experiment at room temperature. The efficiency spectrum was a very broad band, corresponding to the broad structures in the absorption spectra of the sample with a halfwidth of about 2 nm. The effective value to chi(3) was calculated, about 1e-9 esu for the samples.

The implementation of a parallel optoelectronic automaton for a specific algorithm, the 'Lattice-Gas' has been studied. Three components were implemented for this automaton: 
a microelectronic circuit for the treatment; 
a Talbot effect hologram for instructions broadcast; 
optoelectronic modulators for parallel readout. 

This automaton exploits the performances of the electronics for nonlinear operation and the optics for the input and output interconnection. 

The performances of a complete setup for 2 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology (French MCP process) have been estimated as: 
15000 iterations per second; 
0.2 W power dissipation for 100 EPs; 
high connectivity about 1.68 x 1e10 bits/square centimetre. 

Some generalization of the use of such an automaton for other algorithms using symbolic substitution is possible. It can be made by simply changing the contents of the lookup memory.

A fully functional optical adder based on systolic arrays and symbolic substitution (SSL) has been demonstrated. This application shows the feasibility of optical design concepts based on incoherent data processing systems with optoelectronic threshold amplifier arrays. The optical setup applies 4 SSL rules in parallel to a 16 by 16 pixel data plane. Low hardware effort with integrable modules has been achieved.

The results of the comparison of different addition algorithms for parallel digital optical computing showed that the design of high performance parallel arithmetic units with self electrooptic devices (SEEDs) based on the known design methods is not primarily a question of having the right algorithm. It appears that for efficient optical arithmetic units the hardware side must be developed considerably. The assumptions taken for SEEDs, eg limited fan-in and fan-out of 2, application of regular interconnects only and the programmable logic array (PLA) design method based on universal AND stages for generation of all possible minterms, seriously limit the performance of the computing systems, independently of the algorithm used. 

Hence the investigation of other design methods for SEED modules, the application of irregular (holographic for instance) interconnections, and/or the development of more powerful components like 'smart pixels' seem to be necessary in order to benefit from the advantages of digital optical parallel processing. Furthermore, the application of symbolic substitution in parallel adder design using SEEDs should be taken into account.

A board to board optical interconnect system has been developed. The interconnect distance is int he range of some centimetres to some metres. It comprises a 2-dimensional emitter array, a fibre bundle and a monolithic custom designed receiver array for application as a link within a multiprocessor system. Each channel has a data rate of 10 MBit/s.

Nonlocal algorithms that could be implemented on designs of extended cellular logic image processor (CLIP) like machines that incorporate one or more shuffle interconnects have been developed. A first indication of the power of single cycle nonlocal reconfiguration of data lies in the sort procedure that plays a major role in computation. Time savings of up to 1000 compared to dedicated software have been demonstrated for a 32 x 32 8-bit sort with and without a perfect shuffle connection. Such interconnects have been demonstrated optically, using lens combinations or holographic techniques. 

With regard to the system components, the ongoing development of both optically and electrically addressed spatial light modulators is seen as key to fast parallel input, along with parallel data acquisition from disc-like optical storage. The use of SEEDs, and recent advances in pnpn structure optical thyristor components, leads to the question of smart pixels. How much logic should be incorporated into each optical cell? The answer would appear to be the maximum electronics, for both the cell itself and for local connections, that does not compromize the optical parallelism and hence the power of optics to carry out the nonlocal interconnection. 

Finally, the issue of packaging is to be addressed. Our own demonstrators have advanced from independent optical mounts and 2 metre long gas lasers, through rail mounts and solid state lasers, to backplates and diode lasers. The overall size of the latter circuit is of order 50 cm x 50 cm, still considerably too large.

A cellular logic image processor was designed, constructed and successfully operated by interconnecting 2 symmetric self electrooptic effect device (S-SEED) arrays. Some of the design issues associated with the implementation of a free space digital optical system have been addressed. It is argued that pixellated devices are more desirable than other devices and that if differential data representation is used, high contrast is not required.

Silicon on sapphire (SOS) has been studied a nonlinear waveguide at lambda = 1.06 um. Resonant excitation of guided waves in submicron undoped SOS films can be obtained with a neodymium: yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser beam for precise values of the incidence angle by means of a submicron period grating coupler etched in silicon. Sharp and contrasted angular resonances can be observed near the fundamental TEo mode excitation on either the reflected or transmitted beam. The wavelength being slightly smaller than the silicon absorption edge, fast optical and electrical switchings have been observed in the nonlinear pulsed regime (20 ns and 200 ps pulse durations). These switchings result, at first from electronic nonlinearities induced by a carrier density in excess of the order of 1e18 per cubic centimetre due to high optical excitation and later (with 20 ns pulses) from the competition between these effects and thermal nonlinearities of opposite sign due to the fast relaxation of the electron/hole pairs in excess. 

When the devices operate under continuous wave illumination, the predominant nonlinearity has a thermal origin; it can be greatly enhanced by Joule effect, thanks to a voltage applied between electrodes deposited on the silicon film. Studies carried Joule enhanced sensitivity devices using thick silicon substrate as Fabry-Perot resonator and Schottky photodiode structures have shown interesting results in optical bistability with individual devices, although the nonuniformity of the silicon plate thickness has not allowed realization of 2-dimensional arrays. The good spatial uniformity of the TEo resonance on the SOS plate characterized during the studies carried out on an individual device led to the realization of a 6 x 3 gate array. The transfer characteristic in transmission allows NOR logic gate operation in an off axis geometry.

An optical oscillator has been demonstrated by introducing the sample into a hybrid ring resonator with long round trip time. In the case of a bistable input-output characteristic (IOC) of the nonlinear element (using an interference filter in reflection consisting of a glass matrix doped with cadmium sulphur selenide (CdSSe) strong mode locking to the resonator round trip time was obtained with a complex mode structure including Farey tree transitions and mode coexistence. For a barely bistable IOC (realized with a cadmium sulphide (CdS) single crystal) a completely different kind of dynamics was found. Relaxation oscillations became important and stabilized the system to prevent a transition to chaos. Further investigations are concerned with the electrooptic bistability in zinc selenide (ZnSe) single crystals. By applying an electric field perpendicular to the light beam changes of the optical properties due to the temperature change and to the Franz-Keldysh effect were observed.

With the aim of constructing a temperature sensor based on thermally induced optical bistability that can be operated by a conventional diode laser, the absorptive behaviour of gallium arsenide/(aluminium gallium) arsenide (GaAs/(AlGa)As) multiple quantum well structures were investigated. Even at room temperature, these structures exhibit a steep excitonic absorption edge in the near infrared spectral region. With rising temperature, this absorption edge shifts strongly enough to the red to lead to a sharp increase in the absorption of suitable photon energies below the absorption edge of the quantum wells. This opens the possibility of observing thermally induced optical bistability in the sample with moderate pumping intensities. The bistability is observed by focusing an infrared laser beam on the multiple quantum well structure. The transmitted laser intensity shows the switching of the sample between the 2 possible absorptive states. The incident laser intensities at which this switching occurs are extremely sensitive to the temperature of the material surrounding the sample. Using this effect, an optical temperature sensor can be achieved in a very practical design using an optical fibre to guide the incident and reflected laser beam, than could be provided by a diode laser.

Fibre optical sensor systems offer great potential for the application of nonlinear optical switching elements. For practical reasons, a working wavelength in the near infrared wavelength region, where solid state light sources can be used, would be very important. In addition, compatibility of the required light intensities for switching with available solid state light sources as well as high stability with environmental conditions are required. Fast switching speed and high parallelism are of lower importance for these applications. As shown with the bistable etalon with absorbed transmission (BEAT) element, an application with a solid state laser source is, in principle, possible. The concept of the optical reference switch gives an example that even with a rather simple use of such elements, the functionality of an optical sensor system can be enhanced. On the other hand, there is certainly a great effort necessary to improve the properties of optical switching elements, even for relatively simple technical applications.

Shaping of 1.9 ns laser pulses and optical switching behaviour with about 100 ps switching on/off times are measured in a bulk n-gallium arsenide (n-GaAs) Fabry-Perot etalon. The etalon structure is not optimized, having a finesse of about 4 at low incident power. The impurity related fast nonlinearity causes optical switching at wavelengths slightly lower than that of the fundamental absorption edge with incident intensities of about 1e6 W/square centimetre, corresponding to a switch energy of about 1 pJ/square micrometre.

Various solutions have been proposed in order to reduce the individual power consumption of integrated microresonators, and optimize their nonlinear response. In particular, at least one order of magnitude is expected to be gained in the threshold intensity by simply optimizing the structure geometry. Up to now power density thresholds of 500 W/square centimetre have actually been observed. The experimental analysis of the mechanism of the nonlinear saturation has shown that it originates from the saturation of the band-tail absorption, leading to refined criteria in the structure design. The possibility of fabricating nonlinear microresonator arrays whose continuous wave (CW) nonlinear characteristics improve after pixellation has been demonstrated. The alloy mixing technique which has been used allows a good confinement of both carriers and light.

All optical bistability has been observed between 2 different charge distributions in a type II heterostructure. In the OFF state, most charge accumulation occurs in the heart of the structure, while in the ON state holes accumulate at the extremities of the structure. This charge transfer bistability is, in this actual structure, rather slow (10 ns for OFF/ON commutation and about 1 us for ON/OFF commutation). However, a key feature is that it needs no external polarization and then no electrical addressing. Moreover, threshold values are at least 2 orders lower than in current devices based on more classical optical nonlinearities, and an important point is that the structure parameters and experimental conditions are not critical.

The structure and fabrication of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode have been explored. The lowest threshold currents are 16 mA. The light emission is single longitudinal mode at 915 nm wavelength. Under pulsed excitation the maximum output power is 3.5 mW. A wavelength selective photodetector of related structure shows a quantum efficiency of 10% at resonance with 1.5 nm spectral width at half maximum.

The double heterostructure optical thyristor is a promising device for optical information processing. It has the important advantage of combining the receiving, transmitting, and memory functions in a single device, and simultaneously achieving a considerable optical gain. The dynamics of the switching of a single device and of several devices in a winner-ta

Also used are sophisticated instrumental analytics for seed oil quality determinations in early breeding stages (eg gas liquid chromatography (GLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and near infrared reflectance (NIR)), as well as modern biotechnologies. All these techniques are used to enable the selection of high yielding, disease resistant and ecologically well adapted varieties. Further speciality oils high in petroselinic, vernolic and lauric type acids are being developed by domesticating species of Coriandrum, Euphorbia lagascae and Cuphea in field tests under suitable Mediterranean conditions.

Seed oils which have been produced in these genetic and production experiments serve for technical application and physicochemical tests in laboratory and pilot plant scales on the oleochemical base materials including fatty alcohols, sulfonates, alcyl polyglycosides and derivatives manufactured thereof (eg surfactants).

The goal of the project is the developing of sunflower varieties characterized by disease tolerance or resistance and a high oleic acid content. Screening work has been carried out in wild relatives to find out the genetic variability in material to be utilized later on with a series of experiments being carried out to find the best treatments for breaking down dormancy in wild and weedy species. In vitro techniques such as embryoculture and organogenesis have been perfected for furthur studies with several hundred crosses between high oleic acid (HOA) lines being performed. Analysis of some morphological and biochemical characters were carried out in several accessions of species such as Helianthus annuus, Argophyllus, etc which were grown in the greenhouse and in the field. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fingerprinting and random amplified polymorphic DNA marker (RAPD) analysis were applied on the seedlings and plant tissues to find genetic markers. A series of experiments were carried out to find out the best treatments for breaking down dormancy in wild and weedy species.
The aim is to obtain essential methodological know how and basic genetic material towards the development of domestic plant resources and production of economically feasible agronomical seed oils for uses in the chemical industry. Including work on plant breeding, agronomical testing of novel or unconventional crops, oil extraction methods and chemotechnical evaluation of these oils by the chemical industry, this project covers the entire vegetable oil production chain. 

Two crop species, rapeseed (Brassica napus) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus), will be the main subjects. These represent the crops producing highest oil yields in the northern and southern European area, respectively, and are at present almost exclusively seed oils for food uses. In order to open additional new markets for nonfood, oleochemical uses, appropriate new varieties with additional production and/or oil qualities will be developed and tested. The particular objectives are as follows. 

Agronomically adapted stocks of high erucic acid rapeseed (HEAR), high oleic acid rapeseed (HOAR), high oleic acid sunflower (HOAS), and disease resistant HOAS, will be constructed and established at a scale allowing for the production of sufficient samples for work on oil extraction methods and testing the oils in the the chemical industry. In addition to these major crops for which large scale application seems to be feasible, three lesser known (unconventional) crops will be evaluated and agronomically tested (high petroselinic acid Coriander, high vernolic acid Euphorbia, and high MCFA Cuphea). 

High pressure extraction of sunflower oil will be tested and evaluated with regard to its influence on the industrial qualities of the oil and the byproducts. Commercially available techniques will be used to produce the oils for testing in the chemical industry. The oils, which are provided by the participants of the project, will be evaluated with regard to their utility in the production of certain base chemicals. The base chemicals produced will be tested for the preparation of deochemical derivatives which could be the basis for surfactants and surfactant mixtures. These surfactants will be evaluated with regard to their technical, economical and econological characteristics. A final assessment will be made of the feasibility of a novel vegetable oil chain becoming possible. 

The final outcome from this project is expected to be manifold but should be of interest to both farming and the chemical industry. Farmers will get information on, and seeds for, novel crops for which a market potential could be assessed. The chemical industry will get information on the potential usefulness of vegetable oils as a raw material which might open up new developments in the area of environmentally sound chemistry.";;;;CSC;NORDDEUTSCHE PFLANZENZUCHT HANS-GEORG LEMBKE KG;DE;"Estação Agronómica Nacional;Henkel KGaA;Agrotecnía de Semillas SA Agrotec SA;GIE Serasem;Semundo Italia Srl;Università degli Studi di Pisa;Región de Murcia;Portusem Sementes;Baslini Industrie Chimiche SpA;Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA);Universität Bayreuth;RUHR-UNIVERSITY BOCHUM;Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen;GEORG-AUGUST-UNIVERSITY GOETTINGEN;Università degli Studi di Udine";"PT;DE;ES;FR;IT";
18118;5210;AIMS;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Advanced Information Management System;01/11/1990;30/11/1993;;"The AIMS project aims to develop an advanced knowledge management system for the more efficient handling of complex information structures. It will consist of an object-based representation language coupled with databases and equipped with a set of tools for knowledge-base construction and access.

Its central core consists of a knowledge representation (BACK) system with an expressive high-level access language, a hybrid reasoning system managing classes under the paradigm of terminological reasoning, and components for assertions and rules. A conceptually oriented coupling of the representation system with a conventional database system interface and integration with advanced persistency techniques are foreseen. 

In order to reuse existing information sources, methods and tools for the integration of databases with conventional structures are under investigation. A management component for multimedia objects and its integration with the representation system is being designed and implemented. 

The research-oriented results will be transformed into the final working environment, which focuses on efficiency in implementation. Tools for knowledge-base access are also being developed, taking into account the specific needs of the access language and the knowledge-base structure. 

The results of AIMS are being proved for quality and validity on the basis of real application requirements. Target applications are intelligent information systems characterised by complex object descriptions and rich deductive interrelations, such as collaborative, distributed system design and software engineering, and office automation.";;;;;Datamont Feruzzi Group SpA;IT;"ERITEL;UNIVERSITAT DEL PAIS VASCO;Non Standard Logics;DEUTSCHES HERZZENTRUM BERLIN;Quinary SpA;Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales - ONERA;Technische Universität Berlin";"ES;FR;DE;IT";
8249;3125;MEDLAR;;FP2-ESPRIT 2;;FP2;Mechanising Deduction in the Logics of Practical Reasoning;01/11/1989;31/07/1992;;"The MEDLAR Action aimed to produce a general framework for deduction in the logics of practical reasoning by internal analysis of different logics, so that various logics and deduction calculi can be mixed. Benchmarks were provided for the capacity of a class of logics to characterise central problems in achieving better human/computer interaction and robot action planning.
The project developed the community's capacity for mechanized reasoning about time and action, the beliefs and knowledge of agents, their intentions and their obligations. These tasks arise naturally in interactive environments, for instance in seeking to provide helpful answers in a travel reservation system or the actions of a robot. Logics for reasoning about such situations are aptly called the logics of practical reasoning by philosophers.

The initial approach involved 3 activities:
case studies in human/computer interaction and robot planning;
evolution of a (potentially multimodal) class of logics capable of practical reasoning with time, action and intent;
development of basic techniques for mechanized deduction with the logics of practical reasoning.

Later activities sought to consolidate this earlier research by planning future exploitation and developing general techniques for interfacting logics and deduction calculi, applying to selected case studies for evaluation.
A series of technical workshops were used to manage the gathering and dissemination of information throughout the consortium and within the wider scientific community.

The interim results of the first 3 activities were presented as 3 collections of initial scientific papers for the first milestone review and subsequently a public workshop at Silwood Park, United Kingdom. These collections are on human computer interaction (HCI) and robotic problems, logics of practical reasoning and the deduction calculi. It is intended that the revised papers for these workpackages will appear in an edited volume.

This study involves seeking an integrated framework for mechanizing nonclassical logics. The particular logics and calculi are structured from the point of view of applications. As a first example for testing the prototype of the general framework, a generalized interpretation of modal logics is investigated. Next, the methodology of labelled deductive systems is introduced, demonstrating why this approach for a general framework is adequate to integrate various logical systems via a unified methodology. Finally, the need for different operational methods of solving problems in formal logic has been assessed in the context of an ambitious example suggested from MEDLAR case studies.
APPROACH AND METHODS 
The initial approach involved three activities: 
-case-studies in human/computer interaction and robot planning 
-evolution of a (potentially multi-modal) class of logics capable of practical reasoning with time, action and intent 
-development of basic techniques for mechanised deduction with the logics of practical reasoning. 
Later activities sought to consolidate this earlier research by: 
-planning future exploitation 
-developing general techniques for interfacing Logics and Deduction calculi, applying to selected case studies for evaluation. 
A series of technical workshops were used to manage the gathering and dissemination of information throughout the consortium and within the wider scientific community. 
PROGRESS AND RESULTS 
The interim results of the first three activities were presented as three collections of initial scientific papers for the first milestone review and subsequently a public workshop at Silwood Park, UK. These collections are on HCI and Robotic Problems, Logics of Practical Reasoning, and on the Deduction Calculi. It is intended that the revised papers for these workpackages will appear in an edited volume. 
The Action has held scientific workshops attended by workers both from other ESPRIT projects and from non-EC countries, as well as supporting other closely related meetings. 
The outline of a general labelled deduction system framework for mixing various logics and calculi has emerged. 
The work of this Actions will be continued in the MEDLAR II Basic Research project (6471), where the emphasis will be on developing the concept of a practical reasoning agent, capable of acting autonomously and interacting flexibly with its real world environment. 
POTENTIAL 
This Action has: 
-thrown light on the design of a future deduction workstation in which special-purpose problem solvers and planners cooperate 
-provided know-how for the design of specific automated reasoning systems, like robot action planners and interrogatable databases 
-advanced the science of automated reasoning 
Future work in the MEDLAR II project includes the design of a Medlar Practical Reasoner and scientific collaboration with more applied projects.";;;;;IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;UK;"J.

The aim of this project is to improve the processes currently employed in this sector of biotechnology with special emphasis on the vectors and promoters used and on the quality of post translational modification. 

The task of this project is to: 

isolate promoters from CHO which are strong and/or inducible by alterations in the culture conditions; 
achieve targeted integration of DNA into a region of the CHO genome which may be amplified;  
monitor the glycosylation profile of a protein made in CHO under these different conditions.  

At all stages comparisons will be made with the vector host systems currently in use. The project involves both genetic and cell culture methods to achieve the goal of improved productivity from animal cells.";;;;CSC;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, GALWAY;IE;"Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia;MRC Collaborative Centre;Dublin City University;UNIVERSITY OF BIELEFELD;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PAVIA";"IT;UK;IE;DE";
